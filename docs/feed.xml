&lt;p&gt;First, I am excited to announce that I am almost done with my first run through all of the clojure koans!  This is very exciting.  I’ve also made some more improvements to my blog page, such as inserting a non-functioning email subscription input &amp;amp; button!  Very exciting stuff.  For now (and for looks) I think I’m going to just leave it there (it will actually get pushed with this blog post).  I’ll leave it as a reminder to figure how to get that to actually work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The koans have been fun.  I can see how &amp;amp; why clojure is considered to be such a powerful language.  It just has abilities that make the readibility of the code a lot simpler if you understand the language.  I believe it also makes it more difficult to royally mess up a program, but I’m still learning this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also started reading Programming Clojure.  I haven’t gotten very far, but I think this will be a good source for me going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for everything else, well, my boss actually got back to me pretty quickly, and he has agreed to lay me off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, as you might infer from my last post, I was a little disappointed, but in our conversation, he told me that he really appreciated me coming forward to him early and my willingness to support the site.  He also told me that he admired me for this action, which struck me with both surprise and deeply (he’s not the type to admit admiration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose in a way, I’m sacrificing myself even if for mutual gain.  My site will survive this better with me having communicated my plans to them, and I learned (I think) that my ‘sacrifice’ will save not one, but two employees from the chopping board!!  This of course, in itself, made me once again question my sanity—my salary is enough to save 2 other employees at a time when there will be a huge oversupply of engineers, and I’m choosing to give it up and jump into this starving pool of plenty??!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it feels pretty good to have made a non-related life choice that is now allowing me to save the jobs of two other people.  That’s pretty cool, and even with the little jab, I have no regrets about this choice I’ve made.  In fact, it’s just the opposite.  I’m excited, and actually, back to my previous point, I’m relieved that he didn’t ask me to stay on to do that one task I mentioned last week.  It’s all I’ve been doing this week, and it takes up a lot of time when all the units are running.  Plus, it gave me an idea for something I could maybe do “after” all of this.  But more on that at another time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">So just a couple things to touch base on as I document this adventure.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">i think this might work</title><link href="/blog/2020/05/23/i-think-this-will-work.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="i think this might work" /><published>2020-05-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/blog/2020/05/23/i-think-this-will-work</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2020/05/23/i-think-this-will-work.html">&lt;p&gt;I think this might work…  All of it.  Things are coming together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, my website, while still purple, is looking a lot cleaner.  I’ve been able to re-size the image on the homepage so that it’s not distorted.  I was able to set the text in both the about page &amp;amp; the blogs to justify, and this is saying a lot, because in order to do that, I had to dive into the main.css and the about index to get an understanding of how the classes work.  Finally, look at my second blog from last week.  It is so much cleaner than it was!  I even got the list numbers to display at the correct size and add cleaner margins to the lists.  This is all exciting stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the website, I am now set up to solve clojure koans pretty efficiently.  So far I’ve gotten through the first two sets, and ya know, I really enjoy those.  Like little puzzle to help learn the language.  They are fun, and they are a great way to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to have an apple computer soon also, as that will make all of this a little bit more straight forward (or at least that’s what I’m told).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else might work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, work!  My job.  After careful &amp;amp; thoughtful consideration, I decided I was going to be up front with my boss about my plan.  You see, I’ve been back at the site this week, mainly because I wanted to snoop around a little bit by have my ears perked open.  This paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, we have a global health crisis on-going due to the coronavirus and the economy is not doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on Tuesday that suddenly my boss &amp;amp; two of the other managers were behaving a little bit different: closing their office door, whispering, &amp;amp; gathering repeatedly.  I sensed layoffs were coming or at least some kind of cutting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little more contemplation on the best way to play my cards, I was able to come up with a few proposals for him, so yesterday, I asked to speak with him.  I told him that I was not formally resigning right now, but that I did have intentions to leave the company.  I explained that if layoffs are coming that “I volunteer as tribute!”.  Once I got my nerves under control, I proposed my other ideas also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I resign, and we make it a clean cut.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because he knows I’m leaving anyway, they lay me off in place of someone else who is still adding value.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I resign, but I stay on board for a few extra weeks, strictly working remotely to help ensure we have a smooth quarter end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(or, and this one is my favorite) I don’t resign and don’t get laid off, and instead we negotiate some terms for me to work strictly remotely part-time covering a dumb tasks that we call IRA, which the engineers are currently required to do every day and I happen to be very good at—I’m actually the best on site and mentor the others on how to do these transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was very appreciative that I told him what was going on ahead of making the cut as well as being willing to continue to support the site.  He was actually really interested in option 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, my company is in a weird way with this economic crisis, and he knows this.  If I quit, the odds are very high that he would not be allowed to backfill my position, so they’d be down a person.  I am very good at IRA, and he trusts me more than anyone else to get it right.  Even if I only work 1-3 hours a day, I would be giving the engineers 3-10 manhours back each day, and having one point-person to go to for IRA questions would highly benefit him.  They’ve wanted a role like this at the plant for years now, but the learning curve is very steep and there must be an understanding of the units and SAP to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that with what I’m about to be studying, I would expect that I could find an efficient way to streamline the whole process for them—this is one of those things I mentioned in the last post that I’ve wanted to do for years, but just don’t have the skillset—yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he could try to cut my pay, but to do so, he’d have to go through HR.   So again, with the times being weird, if he asks for permission, he risks them saying no to all of it.  I believe it would be in his best interest to just work this out with me &amp;amp; the plant manager for a mutually beneficial arrangement at least until the chaos dies down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 4 is a win-win for both of us, so…  I think this might work!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I think this might work… All of it. Things are coming together!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Changing the Future</title><link href="/blog/2020/05/17/changing-the-future.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Changing the Future" /><published>2020-05-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/blog/2020/05/17/changing-the-future</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2020/05/17/changing-the-future.html">&lt;p&gt;Alright, so far I’ve learned how to build my very own website using GitHub, which has been pretty fun.  Inline with that, I’ve now also had some exposure to Jekyll, CSS, &amp;amp; Markdown, so… progress!  I was even able to get a picture uploaded to my page and got it centered!  Do I understand everything that I did and would I be able to recreate it without the tutorial guide?  Not everything and probably not, but it’s a start, and so I’m happy with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, let’s kick this whole thing off by laying down some facts about me &amp;amp; what’s actually going on in my head right now.  It’s actually probably a good idea for me to write down everything that I’ve been thinking recently, so that in the coming months, especially if things get hard, I can look back on why I’m doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I doing?  That’s probably the best place to start, and the answer is that I’m jumping ship from the career that I’ve spent nearly a decade trying to build and become successful at in order to focus on becoming proficient at writing software.  My goal is to have developed proficient enough software skills to be employable within the next 3-6 months.  While I’m doing a little here and there beforehand, my plan is to leave my current job and start on this full-time in mid-June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a family consisting of my husband, Keith; my 2 year-old and 7.5 month old sons, Rex &amp;amp; Leo; my two rottweilers, Brusly &amp;amp; Tails; and my two cats, Wasabi &amp;amp; Cheddar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it’s not necessary to my plan that I explain this, it’s important to me that I make it clear that I’m not dissatisfied with my current career.  It has done well by me, and I hope that I’ve left a footprint or two. My job is not one that I would call a “cushy” job, because it is very challenging and even more-so demanding, but it can be a lot of fun and it makes me feel important.  I say “important”, because in my job as a Production Supervisor over three multi-million-dollar chemical plants that each produce a high-value, highly specialized chemical, I make big; high-dollar; and safety-conscience decisions on a daily basis.  Over time and sometimes individually, these decisions have the ability to make noticeable impacts on the immediate &amp;amp; downstream supply chains, the economy, and, ultimately, your life.  I think that many people would not enjoy that kind of pressure, but I happen to love it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should also note that even with an on-going pandemic causing the job market to shatter,  my job is pretty secure, I think.  My facility has been ramping up production ever since CoViD19 in order to help out with healthcare &amp;amp; military needs.  My job is what they call “essential”.  But just because holding the job is secure, a crashing job market means that it may not be there for me once I leave it, so that makes  this decision a little scary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question is “why am I doing this?”.  It’s funny, when I started writing this, I went deep into describing why I’m leaving my secure, more-certain world and what’s wrong with it after having just told you that I actually enjoy it.  Then I thought about what I believe I will gain from this decision–that is afterall, how I sold the idea to Keith.  When I thought about it that way, the reasons became quite simple.  So on to the next list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe that this path will bring about a better quality of life for me &amp;amp; my family:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While my boys will still be going to school for the time being to allow me to commit fully to learning so that I can become employable within a reasonable amount of time, I will be more available to them overall both short-term, and more importantly, long term: the image of myself 5 years from now, in an almost magic-like way, faded from seeing myself stressing with Keith about who is going to leave work to pick Rex &amp;amp; Leo up by 6PM from the afterschool program and changed into seeing myself breaking from what I’m working on in order to stand in my own driveway and greet Rex as he walks off the school bus.  It was as if, in the moment I made this decision, I changed the future, and the weight off my shoulders in the moment was immense.  And I’d had no idea that I’d even been carrying it.  Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think this is going to be easy or that it will always be possible to carry out that vision, but what I can tell you, is that right now, my current job makes that vision an impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I will now be able to fully support Keith in his own career instead of having our careers conflict constantly over who needs to be at the plant at any given moment and who’s plant is more important.  If he wants to get to work by 6AM, I will now be able to help him do that since we won’t both need to be racing out of the house in the morning to make 7AM meetings.  If there’s another pandemic, I can (again), support Keith by taking the kids up north to get help, but this time without feeling an immense guilt of being a bad employee.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think my overall well-being will improve, which will allow me to be a better &amp;amp; happier mother &amp;amp; wife.  Right now, I’m trying to meet a true and extreme double-standard of working a highly demanding job in a 24/7 plant requiring my almost constant attention and that of being a mother to two young children, while still supporting my husband in his demanding job and trying to take care of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to learn to write software, I’ve wanted to for a long time, and I have the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I went back and forth on listing this one first or second, but in the end, my family comes first.  If I didn’t think that this would lead to a better quality of life for all of us, then no matter how much I want to learn to code, I probably wouldn’t be making this drastic of a change in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This may seem like a sudden maybe even impulsive decision, but it’s not.  I’ve thought about this for years, and I have great role-models &amp;amp; mentors within my immediate family for this, so I have a unique opportunity that I probably should have asked for earlier.  I just hadn’t had the guts to do it, and to be honest, I think I was embarrassed to ask for the help–in a way it kind of feels like I’m saying I messed up or that I’m giving up, but I don’t think I have and I don’t think I am.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been writing little bits of code for years in my current job, and the pleasure that I get when a little program finally works or I find a better way to make it work, is a high.  I will spend hours (like weeks) of time writing the code in effort to build little reports or programs when I have no doubt that I could have just manually performed the task in minutes, maybe an hour.  Writing a program to automate or streamline a task is just so much more fun than actually doing the task.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But my skills are limited.  By definition of an engineer, I am a problem solver.  When there are tasks that could be done better, whether it’s the distillation of parameters in purifying a chemical or a daily task that could be performed faster or more accurately with software, it’s in my nature to want to solve that problem, so when I see a problem that could be solved with software and can visualize the solution to, it gets really frustrating when I just don’t have the knowledge on how to get from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s it.  I am leaving behind my career and setting out to learn how to write software, and the reasons I’m doing this are I believe this path will bring about a higher quality of life for me &amp;amp; my family and because I want to learn to code.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Alright, so far I’ve learned how to build my very own website using GitHub, which has been pretty fun.
