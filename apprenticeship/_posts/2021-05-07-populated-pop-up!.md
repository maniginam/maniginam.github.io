Title:  Populated Pop Up!
date: 2021-05-07

Ok.  That’s my last commit & push for the day.  I will not allow myself to do another one, because if I do, I will do it all night.

It’s done restarting.  Let’s try it!  You can be with me for this attempt.

OMG!!!!  It worked!! Kind of…  I mean suddenly, all the rooms & permalinks are showing up in this silly little unformatted popup.  I had been hoping it would work like with every past commit, but the probability had me really leaning toward and expecting it to not work, but I am ecstatic now!

Except, shoot!  Now, i want to make the links work, because they are not working for some reason--and these are kind of ugly, but I swore no more commits tonight, which I can totally do!  I mean it’s not like it’s hard to not make just one more commit just to make the links work…

I will not do it!  I will not commit again tonight.

Not even one more time!  I will not commit here or there.  Not in a house or with my magic mouse. I will not commit or send a push.  I will not commit again, so sush!

No, but seriously, this is a great way to end the night--the rooms are there!  In a list.  Yeah, sure, they might have dumb bullet points that I didn’t ask for and now recall might be the default.  But who cares!  The rooms have populated the pop up!!!
