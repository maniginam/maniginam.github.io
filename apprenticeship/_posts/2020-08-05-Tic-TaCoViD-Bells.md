Good news & bad news…  First, there are way too many puns in today’s title…  Let’s start with the first: Tic-Tac-Toe, which is also the good news.

Today, I cleaned up my clojure ttt a little more, and then after his clean code class on names, I reviewed my game with my dad for feedback.  I was looking for feedback & critique on my code in general as a newbie as well as how i went about solving the problem and how i did applying some of the concepts I’ve been learning over the past few weeks.  He gave me some very good pointers on not mixing the user-entries with the business rules, which I knew, but hadn’t applied well. The whole thing could break if someone wanted lower-case x’s & o’s instead of my uppercase and I didn’t change those calls in all places.  I get the importance there.

I also specifically asked about my tests, which in order to get the code to test the human optimal play, i’d had to invent a way to let the program know that it was a test.  He gave me some pointers on how to go about this differently.   There were several other comments, but in the end, he said i should probably feel comfortable sharing this with my big bro with the point it is at, but also warned that he will probably have a lot more to say about it.  I welcome any feedback.  I’m proud of this product, but at the same time, I know there are functions that should be smaller as well as there are things tied together that shouldn’t be.  Also, the dependencies are going the wrong way--after all that!

I also got a “main” function in the ttt today.  Go figure, i’d been running it off the tests the whole time.  It still worked.

Finally, while they are not tied into each other, I did put my java GUI package into the clojure ttt project.  This package has not really been well cleaned and has a lot going on, but it does work.  I even added a ‘resultsBox’ to it.

So that’s the good news:  TicTacToe is ‘done-ish’.  

The bad news, a teacher & baby at the boys’ school just tested positive for covid--i’m actually supposed to have already picked them up--leaving soon!  The school asked me to keep at least Leo home for the rest of the week so that they can do another deep clean, but  I’ll probably just keep Rex home too.  Maybe he will let me watch videos of Bobby--he’ll actually sit & watch those and tell me every time Bobby is in a new costume, “Mommy, look!  That’s Bobby!”  Aside from those videos though, unless they take a well synced nap, i won’t be getting much more done until Monday at the earliest [hopefully].

Rex:  
I don’t think anyone could ever deny that Rex is my kid after they’ve seen him devour taco bell and nacho cheese…  This kid will put back almost a whole bean burrito while dipping/drenching it in nacho cheese before each scrumptious bite.  It’s beautiful!

Leo:  
Leo too!  He’s still just on pintos & cheese--and yes, i feed my 10-month-old baby taco bell--it’s an important right-of-passage.  

Feeding him TB is a little tricky though:  I fill a spoon with some pintos and let him have at it.  Once it’s empty, it consistently takes a moment of hesitant consideration to prepare myself to take the spoon for refill, because if you thought this kid got mad each time I walked out of a room, then you’ve clearly never seen a pinto spoon taken away from him for refill.  Wooh!  Yesterday, i let him hold two spoons thinking, maybe he’d let me have one to refill while he worked on the other.  No Luck!  Better fill that spoon up fast and get it back into his tiny fat hands so the devouring can continue!

Point of the story: There can be no doubt that these boys are my kids and the descendants of their great grandparents who also loved “Taco Bells”!
