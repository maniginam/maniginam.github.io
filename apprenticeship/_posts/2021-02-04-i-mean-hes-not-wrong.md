Title: I Mean, He’s Not Wrong...

I don’t know.  I’m feeling discouraged.  I had at hand what i thought to be a very easy task—i mean i had the whole setup already done.  The game-play, at least in my experience, has been the easy part.

I gave an estimate of 5.xx points for the rest of it—the rest was easy, i thought.  Go figure this is the one time where using the game-play was actually the hard part.  How to get .clj to be called into .cljs, I mean it’s the same stuff right?  

Not really.  I still believe i need macros.  I worked on those today, and about half way through the day, i thought it as going well.  Everything was working, everything was passing, but then I realized, I’d forgotten to delete some old files that apparently, all my new code was depending on, and in fact learned my macros were not working,

A macro is code that runs at compile time, so everything needs to be there for it to run, but what if you don’t have the information that it needs?  Well, that’s where all the “@!~@#$&@#&^~~@$#*” comes in. While, yes i am using foul language to describe this, these symbols also happen to be the context of a macro and how to deal with the syntax--easy to read right?

Argh.  At the end of th day, i was scrambling to just get it back to how i had it.  And after the boys went down, i copy pasted like crazy to just make it work—argh.  It was painful and felt ugly, and I am ashamed.  

Sometimes I wonder how it would be working in an office for this.  In an office, I would be surrounded by experts just across the wall or maybe even sitting at the same table.  No one likes to be interrupted in their zone, but I doubt anyone would refuse help when asked.  At home, i have to ping some someone or text or call contacts that i have to see if they are there and available, and then sit on a video chat (which i do not like seeing myself on video chat).  It’s way easier to just pop over to the room next to you and ask for help.  

I’m discouraged.

Rex:  
So the poddy-fairy came last night and brought Rex a huge box full of monster trucks.  The thing is though that she gave me very explicit directions that Rex may only have a monster truck once he puts some poo-poo or pee-pee into the poddy.  

I felt bad that this actually stressed him out a lot, but even through his stress, he declared that he didn’t want a diaper and wanted to sit on the poddy.  He put in a lot of effort this morning, so when he was able to produce about 3 drops, i opted to count that as satisfactory for the first prize, but explained that for the next one, the fairy told me that she expected a lot more.  

I hate to stress the kid out, and that was not my intent, but he’s now asking to go sit on the poddy!

Leo:  
Speaking of poddy, this morning we had two dirty diapers.  I asked Leo to go throw them away.  He more than happily obliged, but where did he throw them away? I did not know—i was getting Rex dressed while he was throwing them away.  I went to the bed room and looked in the trash & laundry, nope.  I went to the bathroom, but nope there’s no trash in there.  I went into the office & the guest room, i went everywhere.  No diapers… hmmm...

Then tonight i was giving them a bath, and just after I pulled Rex out, he opened the lid of the toilet—there they are!!!  He threw the dirty tippers away in the first thing he could find that looked like a garbage—i mean, it’s not what I’d meant, but he’s not wrong...
