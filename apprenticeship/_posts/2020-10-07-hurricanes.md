So I’ve lived in Baton Rouge since Jan 1, 2012.  That August hurricane Isaac came through.  It was a little gusty, but not too bad.  The perk to it was that I got a full paid but vacation-cost-exempt week off of work.  It was great!  

Every year since, I’ve secretly hoped for another hurricane, and in fact, being new to Baton Rouge and from the north where i heard about hurricanes all the time, i expected at least one a year.  But no.  For the next seven years, there were no hurricanes.  A couple hard rains like The Great Flood of 2016 (which actually was pretty horrific), and of course, I was in water treatment at the time, so worked double.  But no, no hurricanes since 2012.  This year, my first hurricane season where I wasn’t working in the plants and actually depend on child care and time to learn as quickly as possible, I’ve had to prep for 3.5!  The first ones, a combined Marco & Laura, took almost a whole week from my learning.  Two weeks later Sally threatened us again, and now Delta is coming about half force at the gulf coast on Friday with near perfect aim at Baton Rouge—although, unfortunately it’s looking like it’s going to take another toll from Lake Charles—they are not as protected as we are in W Baton Rouge.

Anyway, a few good things happened today.  First, i practiced game-of-life again, and it went a lot better this time.  There are still some orders I need to sort out, but overall it’s looking a lot cleaner.  I need to get some feedback on it to see if there are any other improvements I can make on it. My dad was actually supposed to be coming down tomorrow, and I was going to show him then (as well as ttt), but i guess I’ll just send it to him.  I also need to figure out how to get the GUI in a different src directory functioning with it. 

Then, after stand up, I finally had an idea for a CCs blog post.  Because I don’t really have a lot of knowledge yet and thus nothing professionals would necessarily want to read, I’ve decided to take the novice approach and write about what I do know—beginner stuff.  If the group is good with it, I will submit a true how-to-make-your-computer-do-stuff post.  Years ago, when I first wanted to learn how to code more, i played with online learning platforms, which were great for learning a language but taught nothing about implementing code locally.  I also tried a number of times to get koans working, but never with success for the simple reason that I didn’t know how to get my computer set up, so I gave up.  This was the barrier for me, and if it was a barrier for me, I would be willing to bet that it is also a barrier for others who are interested in learning.  So that will be my post.  Getting set up to do koans locally on your computer while also cloning and pushing to git.  I think it would be good for any novice just looking to get their feet wet, and if they jump in, then they will remember that CC’s is who got them started out right.  We’ll see how it goes, but i figured i could make a video to go along with it also that the blog would point to, upping our YouTube views.  Yay!

Lastly, after quite some hours spent, i was able to save a ttt game using sql.  I’m not sure If I’m dong it 100% right as i knew SQL was a language but thought it was also its own database, but i had to get a separate hosted database—honestly, I’m really not sure what all I’ve done.  I’ve done a lot, but hey! It’s kind of working.  Tomorrow, I will figure out how to pull the info back out and parse out some of my keywords back to how the GUI uses it.  

I’ve actually been putting a focus on implementing these functions without altering my existing code at all—you know, closed for modification.  At first it seemed impossible and that i would no doubt have to alter my code without some other kind of work around, but after investigating more, I don’t think that’s necessarily true.

Rex:  
The other day Rex was singing gramma’s song about the monkey’s jumping on the bed and it went like this:  “Three little monkeys jumping on the bed.  One fell off and bumped his head.  Mommy called the doctor, and the doctor said, ‘Hello?’”

Leo:  
Leo walked!!  I officially marked his first steps on his birthday, but today, he balanced as I let him go, and then he took like 5 steps!!
