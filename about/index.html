    <h1>Hi! I'm Gina.</h1>
    
    <p>I'm still what I consider to be a "new" mother of two very cute little boys, Rex & Leo.  I live in Lousiana with my husband,
    the two boys, two rottweilers, and two cats.  I am a chemical engineer & MBA by degree and have spent the last 9 years
    working in major chemical plants producing materials such as UF6; Cl2, VCM, & PVC; and most recently specialty, low-global-warming-potential,
    non-ozone depleting HFO gasses.</p>
