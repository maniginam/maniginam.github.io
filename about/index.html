<div class="about">
    <h1>Hi! I'm Gina.</h1>
    
    <p>I want to bridge the gaps that exist in chemical manufacturing and manufacturing in general.
     I want to fix whatâ€™s broken and inefficient; and I want to leave the industry a little bit better than how I found it.
     </p>
     <p>
     My mission is to build bridges over the rivers & canyons that inhibit daily task efficiency within my former industry,
     chemical manufacturing, by implementing my freshly learned and refactored skill-sets that will forge as I work to become
     the best developer that I can be within my future industry, software.
    </p>
