    <h1>Hi! I'm Gina.</h1>
    
    <p>I'm still what I consider to be a "new" mother of two very cute little boys, Rex & Leo.  I live in Lousiana with my husband,
    the two boys, two rottweilers, and two cats.  I am a chemical engineer & MBA by degree and have spent the last 9 years
    working in major chemical plants producing materials such as UF6; Cl2, VCM, & PVC; and most recently highly-specialized, non-flammable, "green" aerosols & foaming agents.
    <br>

    Recently, I set out on a new endeavor--to learn to write software.
    <br>

    This website is about the adventures of learning to code while mothering two beautiful little boys--I don't want to be misleading,
    the boys go to 'school' during the week, so that I can actually get some learning in.  Regardless, this is their adventure too.
