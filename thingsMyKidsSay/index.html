    <h1>Things My Kids Say</h1>

    <p>Right now, Rex is the only one who can talk, but I want to capture some of the things he says, because they are just so funny & nonsensical--and he has no idea!</p>

    <ul type="disc" style="font-size:18px">

            <li>Mom: Rex What do you want for dinner?
                Rex: Umm...  Trucks!</li>
            <li>Rex: {picking up a tree star} Look Mom!  A Star Fish!</li>
            <li>Rex: Mom, I need a donut! And I need cake.</li>
            <li>{7/8/2020 at bed time} Mom: Good Night Rex.
                Rex: Mom!  I need a transfer truck and a green flatbed truck!
                Mom: {obliges and meets his request}
                Rex:  Not this truck!!  A different truck!</li>
            <li>{at bed time} Dad: Good Night Rex.
                Rex: Umm... Wait.  I need a man, a cone, and a truck!
                Dad: {obliges and gets a man, a cone, and a truck}
                Rex:  Not this truck!!  A different truck!</li>
