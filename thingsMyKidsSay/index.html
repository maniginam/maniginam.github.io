    <p>Right now, Rex is the only one who can talk, but I want to capture some of the things he says, because they are
        just so funny & nonsensical & just so darn cute!</p>

            <li>This is one of my favorites that I've hesitated to post, as i don't want to embarrass the kid, but
                it's <i>so</i> worthy.
                <br>Rex could name all 8 planets plus the dwarf before he could count, but he didn't say them all
