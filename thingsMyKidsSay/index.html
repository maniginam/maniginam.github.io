 <p>Right now, Rex is the only one who can talk, but I want to capture some of the things he says, because they are
  just so funny & nonsensical & just so darn cute! <br>
 2022 - Leo now says stuff too! <br>
 2023 - Leo says A LOT now! <br></p>

 <ul type="disc" style="font-size:18px">

  <br>
  <li>{12/03/2023 At Bathtime}
   <br>Rex & Leo {singing in unison} It's raining Tacooooos!  They're falling from the skyyyyy!
   <br>
   Rex {in speaking tone}: Ok!  Now let's play 'Does Leo Bend That Way?'
   <br>
   Keith: Uh, yeah... No, we're not playing that game...
  </li>
  <br>

  <br>
  <li>{03/13/2022 at Planetarium - Gift Shop}
   <br>Clerk: What's your favorite planet?
   Leo: Uh...  Moon! <br>
   Clerk: Dude, that's not a planet! <br>
   Leo: Uh... Penis! <br>
   Clerk: {blushes}  Um... okay... <br>
   Mom:  {giggles}
  </li>
  <br>

  <br>
  <li>{11/24/2021 Hayward, WI}
   <br>Rex: Mommy! Watch me!  You can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man! <br>
   Leo: Mommy! Watch me!  eee-eee oooo aah eee eeee eeeee eeeee inner man! <br>
   Me: Oh!  Are you the gingerbread man? <br>
   Leo: Yiomp (which is how he says yes=)
  </li>
  <br>

  <br>
  <li>{11/22/2021 at Blackiron restaurant in Hayward, WI}
   <br>I gave both boys a dollar to put in the jukebox to pick a song to play.  Leo impatiently and eager to put his dollar in the machine stood there crying and
   protesting that it was his turn while Keith was holding Rex to help him select a song.
   The waitress then brings the parm & crushed red pepper or the pizza to the table.
   I showed the parm shaker to Leo and said: Leo look!  Parmesan!
   Leo {threw his dollar on the floor as if he no longer needed money and ran to the table}: Parmesan!  My parm!  Nummy!
  </li>

  <br>

  <br>
  <li>{11/22/2021 at Blackiron restaurant in Hayward, WI}
   <br>Me: Look at all the stuff here.  There's glasses and masks and seasoning and pickles<br>
   Rex: And look mommy!  Coffee buckets!

  <li>{11/16/2020 upset that he can't come with me to take our dog Brusly to the vet}
   <br>Rex: aww. I just want to be doctor.<br>

   it's <i>so</i> worthy.
