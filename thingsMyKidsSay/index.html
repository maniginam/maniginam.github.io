    <h1>Things My Kids Say</h1>

    <p>Right now, Rex is the only one who can talk, but I want to capture some of the things he says, because they are
        just so funny & nonsensical--and he has no idea!</p>

    <ul type="disc" style="font-size:18px">
            <b>
                <li>{7/19/20 during bath time}
                    Rex: {pointing at nipple} "What's that?"
                    Mom: That's your nipple.  You have 2 nipples.
                    Rex: No.  I don't.  A dinosaur ate my nipples.

                    <br>Dad: Good Night Rex.
                    <br>Rex: Umm... Wait. I need a man, a cone, and a truck!
                    <br>Dad: {obliges and gets a man, a cone, and a truck}
                    <br>Rex: Not this truck!! A different truck!</li>
                <br>
                <li>{7/8/2020 at bed time}
                    <br>Mom: Good Night Rex.
                    <br>Rex: Mom! I need a transfer truck and a green flatbed truck!
                    <br>Mom: {obliges and meets his request}
                    <br>Rex: Not this truck!! A different truck!</li>
                <br>
                <li>Mom: Rex What do you want for dinner?
                    <br>Rex: Umm... Trucks!

                <li>Rex: {picking up a tree star} Look Mom! A Star Fish!</li>
                <br>
                <li>Rex: Mom, I need a donut! And I need cake.</li>
