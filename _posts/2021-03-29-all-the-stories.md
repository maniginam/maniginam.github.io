Well, yikes!  It’s officially been 11 months since my last birthday, which means I only have a month left in the first half of this decade.  Argh.

This is totally ignorant and, well, really quite stupid, but when I was 23, i never thought forward to one day being in my thirties.  In fact, i lived very much in a never-never land and on some level believed that I would be 23 forever.  But then to my dismay, 24 not only had the gall to come at me like a bat out of hell, but then exactly one month shy of a decade ago, it too like 23 and all the years prior, left me for those a year younger.  As the years continue to come and go, I still can’t get over just how stupid that was but also that it happened...

Anyway, just an embarrassing little anecdote about me.

It’s been a little while since I’ve had one of those days where I have a tough time getting into the jog of productivity, but today was one of those days.  Typically, i get to my computer, and I eat some breakfast while I check my crypto & emails or pay some bills or get that thing I really need from amazon.  Then within 30 mins to an hour, I dive right into whatever I’m working on and work for the next 9-10 hours.  

Not today.  I’m not sure what it was.  Perhaps because I was gone last week and had some catch up to do or perhaps it’s because I got a little distracted by silver coins, but it took me a little bit to get going.  

Once I finally did, I continued to work on getting the stories out of Trello.  As I’d thought, i need the token I went in circles trying to get last week, but then I didn’t know what to do with it.  I thought I could just call the api on the trello object, but nope.  I need to send trello a request and feed it both my key and the secret token.  

I’ve made the request!  That was easy.  But Trello yelled at me with a big red warning that I was blocked and need to give it credentials.  I thought I had as I’d put both the key & token in the request.  Needs to be in the header, which actually makes a lot of sense, so I’m working on learning the client-http library to include a header in the request.  

As I said last week--little wins!  I mean, Trello may have yelled at me, but hey!  I got the request there!  So that was actually pretty exciting!  At least it’s talking to me even if denying me all privileges of being trusted friends.

Rex:  
There is a truly amazing & utterly embarrassing story (with a picture to go with it!!!) about this kid, that I just don’t have the heart to publicly post.  

What I will say is that our most recent attempt to get him remotely interested in potty training has been to follow the advice of our daycare teachers and let him roam freely outside.  So far, he’s not against the idea of going pee-pee outside like he is on the poddy, so that’s a step forward.  

Leo:  
When I got home on Saturday from Austin, this kid tried to dive head first out of his high chair in an attempt to get to me.  When he was finally put on the floor, he sprinted as fast as an 18 month old can wobbly sprint, sat down on my kneeling knee and repeatedly asked me for kisses by ‘pursing’ his lips and saying “mmmmmmmmmmm” [lips touch] “mwaahhh!!”  Over and Over.  He didn’t care that he was covered in mac n cheese and slobber.  I guess I didn’t really either...
