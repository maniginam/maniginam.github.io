Title: Cracking Bonds
date: 2021-03-19

Today was rewarding.  I worked with Micah in the morning & we reviewed my fixes for confetti.  It took some energy, but we were able to crack the bonds of the molecule I’d built with all the atoms I’d pushed into a single map.  

It’s much better now. 

After that, I worked more on my cannon burst.  I did some more physics math (and yes, i know these are easy enough calcs to do without calculus, but if the opportunity arises, why not take a derivative and freshen up on your integration?).  Truth-be-told, it was mostly algebra and a derivative or two, but that counts. Had to remember my trig too…  yikes!   

Anywho, i got it to look a lot better.  The sparkles are still a little too perfectly, though randomly, uniform, so i’ll need to figure that out a bit more, but the overall gravity is working much better now except for the one glitch right as they start to fall….

Rex:  
I showed Rex confetti tonight too.  He enjoyed pushing the button in my sandbox and making it explode.  We pushed it until they all started slowing down after maximizing the computer’s capacity.  We even added his name to the sandbox, and then he asked for Leo’s--come to think of it, i totally pushed that commit and forgot to take their names off..  Whoops.  I will fix.

Then he asked to watch Bobby & Micah’s video, by which he means the clean coders commercial, and so we did.  


Leo:  
When we got in the car for school, i decided to play some music for the boys, which for whatever reason, I don’t actually do often.  I chose “I’m Yours” by Jason Mraz.  The moment it came on and I started singing along, Leo chimed in and started singing along to this song, that to my knowledge, he’d never in his life heard before.  He nailed it!
