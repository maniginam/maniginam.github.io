Title: Leo is Screaming...
date: 2021-03-17

Yesterday was the day.  I’d actually been waiting all month to write yesterday’s post, and then, instead, i got stupidly sick and couldn’t get out of bed.

I was going to write it tonight, but i got a little caught up in the “just-one-more-compile-and-test” trap and now Leo is screaming uncontrollably, and so I must tend to him a bit more--plus, I can’t concentrate on anything with that intensity of music going on.  

So, I today, i got confetti to work.  I’m making a small, minor adjustment to make it a little bit more cool.   This adjustment is making me whip out the old calculus 1 muscles, which is fun, but omg! Leo is screaming, so I guess that’s it’s for now.  

More tomorrow...

Rex:  Read me a book tonight--even if it was upside down and completely wrong, it was the best book ever read to me.

Leo:  Won’t stop screaming--We’ve already done everything!  Even when I try to sit with him and rock him he just squirms and screams.  arhg!
