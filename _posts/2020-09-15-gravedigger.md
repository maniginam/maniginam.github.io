Ok, so as much of a struggle as yesterday was, today turned out to be a very productive day--it’s amazing what going to bed at 8:45 and having your infant only wake once in the night can do for a person’s mood & productivity.

Let’s see, i began the day with coin changer, and again did it well and even made another improvement to it.  Then I spent the rest of the day splitting up my TTT tasks.  I spent the first half of that working to add a 4x4 board option.  I got as far as prompting the user and creating the board-map.  I tried to get it to print, but I think by that point i was a little burnt out on that and really wanted to spend a decent amount of time on the GUI, so I bailed on it and went to the GUI.  

Today was a great day from a GUI stand-point--no it doesn’t work yet, but something amazing happened today!  I added a function to the update-state function in the gui to help it mimic the flow of the terminal game, and suddenly, once the game was set up through the GUI, the terminal printed a board and prompted me!!!  

I know!  Why is that good, Gina?  That is so obviously just plain wrong!  That is not at all what is supposed to happen!  

That’s true.  That’s not supposed to happen, but what it told me was that my GUI & my game are talking to each other!!  They aren’t exactly sure of what to tell the other yet, but at least they are talking!  That was very exciting!  It means I’m on the right track!  I do have to refactor & decouple one of my terminal functions though.  That one is probably going to be a pain, but once it’s done, i should be pretty close.  

So yeah, all in all, it was a great day!

Rex:  
It’s fitting that Rex has recently began to tell us while he eating that he’s crushing his food with his teeth (and chomps), because Rex got to go to the dentist today!  I told him he was going to get to sit in a spaceship chair and from that point forward he was on board with the idea.  He even got to drive the spaceship chair with the buttons!  He did great through every step of the appointment.  The dental assistant even remarked about how awesome he did.  For being so awesome, I reward him with a Gravedigger monster truck--that kid’s face lit up like it was the best day ever.  I think he’s been wanting Gravedigger for a while now.

Leo:  
Leo has also begun to think monster trucks are awesome.  These days, he can frequently be found crawling on all fours with a monster truck (or a car or something good for banging) under one of his hands getting pushed around.  

Leo has also become a master at saying “hi” & “bye”.
