Title: Leo Yum Soup

You know that really spicy Thai lemongrass soup, Tom Yum?  Well, I made some tonight--it was just okay as I didn’t have all the fresh ingredients I needed, but do you want to know who ***loved*** it despite the spice level and even asked for more?  Leo!

I served him his bowl, went back to the counter to get mine.  When I got back to the table, Leo, covered in spicy, lemongrass, slightly curry-fied, broth, looked at me, and said “YUUUUMMMMM-y!”, and then continued to shovel more half spoonfuls both on this his shirt and into his mouth.  Like me, he seems to love fragrant & spicy foods like thai & curry--that kid can put some curry chicken down!

Something I forgot to mention on monday is what I did this past weekend.  Guess.  Just kidding; you’ll never guess it.  I installed a dishwasher pretty much all on my own, including--get this--the electrical wiring!

We’d had it scheduled to be installed for us after delivery, but the store made a dumb mistake, and so we were going to have to wait until Monday to get it put back on the schedule.  I didn’t want to wait, so I pulled out my brand new birthday toolset that Rex & Leo so thoughtfully got for me, and spent the next six hours removing the hold one, hooking up the new one, leak checking it, then wiring it up, and finally running it.  Pretty cool!  I was impressed, but more importantly, so was Keith!

Today, I worked more at Trello.  Then I worked on it with Micah.  That was very helpful.  He got my response from the server to get back through to Trello in a matter of minutes.  Then I had to walk him through a lot of the Trello workflow to get him up to speed as well as tell him about some newer js functions I was using.  We ran into a few hiccups, but overall made enough progress to get me past my roadblock.  Tomorrow, I anticipate finishing up some of my stories.

This weekend will be all about taxes--argh!
