Title: "Objects at the Event"
Date: 2020-06-25

Today was a good day.  I’m being more & more released from my normal work duties which is nice because it allows me more time to code!  It’s amazing how quickly the day goes by when coding.

Today, after updating my dad’s website by removing a cancelled event (and i didn’t break the world doing it!), I spent most of the morning working on Euler #5: smallest possible multiple divisible by every integer between 1 & 20.  I kept getting stuck in an infinite loop between checking to see if the test value was the lowest prime perfect root that I really don’t think should be an infinite loop, but after the umpteenth attempt at rewiring the function, i decided to break from that to come back to it later with fresh eyes.  Hopefully, i’ll get it tomorrow.

After that, I spent some time on tic tac toe doing a bunch of stuff just to un-do a lot of it to get back to where i started today.  I can get an “X” to follow the mouse (which is pretty cool), but i want it to follow the mouse only after the Start event has occurred and the state becomes Your_Turn.   This requires creating a game piece object which creates an X object.  I have no problem creating objects at the set up of the app, but I can’t figure out the best place/time to create an object at an event.  I’ve tried putting it in the switch case, but that seems a little messy--i don’t know.  I’ve asked…

Rex:  
Rex has been a grump the past couple days, but he’s also been pretty cute and needing me--that’s always nice.  Last night, right after i told him he could not have a cookie before dinner, his dad offered him a cookie (he didn’t know i’d already said no).  I asked Rex if he wanted a whole cookie or a half cookie.  He insisted on a whole cookie.  Once he ate, he turned to me and said “I want half a cookie too.”  stinker…

Leo:  
This morning, I put Leo in his little bouncer thing, played one of his songs, and started dancing.  He laughed so hard when he watched me dance.  His smile is just so big and happy.  He also pulled himself up to his feet with very little assistance while I offered his little hands support to do so.
