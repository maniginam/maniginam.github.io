Title: A Thousand and One Requests
date: 2021-04-02
---

I have successfully made several requests to trello now, and all within a matter of seconds…. This is not a good thing.  I mean, it’s good that I am fully able to communicate with trello and get information out all without being yelled at, but it’s probably not a good thing to be bombarding their server with thousands of requests in a short period of time.  In fact, I’m surprised I didn’t get yelled at or permanently kicked off.

Nonetheless, I am getting the information I need.  But my server doesn’t like the information and doesn’t even use my handler to handle it.  Nope.  It gives me a warning & uses an unknown data source handler.  Except for the very first request, which is only made once upon first linking the room.  The multiple requests are coming from the room itself—my guess is because it’s in the DOM and the browser may be calling it repeatedly, except that none of my print tests for other parts of the DOM printed a bunch, but there’s no loop from the unknown data handler, so I’m still a little perplexed.  

Even still, i have the board, and even got the context of the board out in order to assign it’s ID to a room.  Now all I have to do is make one or two more requests in order to narrow everything down to the cards in a linked list, and I actually already know how to do this, so while I think it could probably be finished up in a couple hours, my official estimate is 4 points.  I should be able to finish this task by Wednesday of next week if there are no disturbances.  So i guess that means that my average right now is about two work weeks (so ten days) per task give or take a day.

This isn’t a good average for me right now, however, as I’ve learned that my final apprenticeship task is before me and i will have 7 days to complete it.  I don’t know what it is yet, but my guess is that it’s not going to be a walk in the park and will likely combine a lot of my new skills.  I haven’t asked yet, but I’m considering making a trip to Arizona for this task.  One so that i can be more fully focused and two so that I have help at an arm’s reach if i get stuck.  

I just realized…this task is probably going to be in a foreign language…. yikes!  I wasn’t too intimidated by java when I learned that, but that’s probably because, I’ve seen java everywhere.  Python wouldn’t be back, but only because I have experience with it from like ten years ago…. I’ve heard ruby is pretty simple.  Oh no… It’s going to be C.  I have no idea.  This is all just a guess, but i don’t think it’s an impossible hypothesis.  In fact, i should delete this entire paragraph so that I don’t give anyone any ideas...
