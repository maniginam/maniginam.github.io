Today, we ordered in some of the most amazing Indian food!

This was after I worked with Micah in the morning through afternoon and then attempted to integrate with trello on my own.  I did not do well.  Sometimes I know the concepts of how things work or are supposed to work, but get lost in the details of organizing it.  It’s like following along with a teacher during class when you totally understand every step he’s taking to get home and start your homework only to realize that you have only a slight idea where to start.
