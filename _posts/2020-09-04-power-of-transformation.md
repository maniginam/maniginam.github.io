Today, I completed the bowling kata video and even found a nice song to go along with it.  It’s not perfectly perfect, but it’s not too bad, I don’t think.  In one of my takes, I messed up the main function at the very end by having too many rolls, which caused it not to compile [argh!], so i ended up having to tie my last two takes together some and take a part out where i sat thinking for like 10 seconds about whether I wanted to continue the take or not.  I finished the video, and decided I would do another take of it in the afternoon if I finished tic tac toe on time.

I didn’t, but first, I did finish my presentation.  Hopefully, I’ve got the DIP right, or my presentation is going to be pretty silly on Tuesday—it probably will be anyway.  I made it kind of cutesie with animation and ‘borrowed’ clip-art in my examples. Micah has recruited the other CC’s to watch me present this one, so with the cutesiness and the art, I’m a little nervous now—i guess i would be anyway.

As for ttt; i think i actually did complete all the requirements for the week.  I’ve handled bad user-inputs, the GUI does not print in the tests, and I’ve tested the user inputs.  Two of my user inputs, however, loop around until a valid one is received, and I was only able to test for one iteration of the loop.  I think this might be where the input-streams come into play, but I’m still not quite getting when I would use that for user input.  I suppose unless it opens a file that contains all possible options for a valid input and then returns that map.  

Regardless, i did not finish getting ttt to actually work again.  It is still not playable int he new set up.  I think I’m only like an hour or two from getting it there, so I’m hoping i can work on it a little during this holiday weekend—if the boys allow.  Then I’ll need to clean up the order of all the functions.  They are a little all over the place.

Rex:  
The other day Rex asked if he had a super power.  I told him, I’m not sure.  Do you?  And he told me, “Yes, i have a super power.”  “What is your super power?”  “My super power is Transformation!”  “What?!  Well, 1, i don’t know how you know that word, and 2, that is an awesome superpower!”

Leo:  
I think Leo is starting to say dada: “ahdahdahdadahdah” and maybe even mom “mum-mum-mum-mum”.
