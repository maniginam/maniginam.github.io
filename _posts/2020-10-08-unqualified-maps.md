title: Unqualified - Maps

Today I spent most of the day, and by most, i mean pretty much the whole day, working on getting the SQL code to function.  First it wasn’t returning in unqualified maps, so I had to figure that out.  Then I actually made some good progress and was on a roll.  I got the game to save & load in the terminal.  Then I went to the gui, and got it to work there too, but it isn’t working across the platforms, which is weird.  I’m not sure why…

After a little more messing with it, I let it go so that I could do my game-of-life kata, which actually went pretty well today, so that’s cool.

Honestly, that it for today.

Happy Birthday Bust-a-Butt!
