title: Snake is Yummy!

I’m taking a new approach to winning…  Today I started working on the algorithm for TTT--finally…  And I’ve decided that in writing that, the “win” will very likely just fall out of it, and thus there’s no reason to spend (or for me to have spent) hours & hours trying to define “win”.  

I’m doing the algorithm for TTT in clojure--I’m just more comfortable there, I think.  I didn’t get as far as i wanted--spent too much time on the euler 9 this morning, which I was going to spend 20-30 minutes working on and then swap to TTT, but ended up spending 2.5 hours on it repeatedly thinking “I almost have it! Just 5 more minutes!”  2.5 hours later, I was close, but the final test didn’t work, and I walked away from it--went back to it twice after that, but myself before falling back down that hole.

I’m excited to be working on the algorithm finally.  I think this part will be fun, and it will be good to tie everything together.  Of course, to do this algorithm in clojure, i ended up making just a text-grid as a board, and then realized, this is probably all i needed to do in the first place…  I spent several hours building my beautiful java TTT board GUI…  And ya know, that’s okay.  It’s pretty, and I learned a lot doing it, so I do think it was time well spent.  

More next week…

Rex:  
We were eating steak the other night, and Rex said “Mommy! I eat snake!  Snake is yummy!”.  Not sure where he transitioned that work to be incorrect, because he used to say it correctly, but it sure is cute and funny!

Leo:  
Oh man.  If you want to see an angry baby, drink water in front of Leo and don’t share it!  Or eat food in front of him and keep the food just out of reach.  This kid gets mad and starts yelling! “Rwaaahhaw! Rhwehhwaaaaaah!” [spell check believed the first rant was a word, but told me I should probably check the spelling of the second one… lol anyway…] It is so funny that I almost do these things…  But no, i give in right away and share.
