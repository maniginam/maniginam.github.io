title: Batteries for Brusly?
date: 2020-12-16
---

This is going to be a short one because it’s almost midnight, and I have to get up early with the boys.  

Also, Brusly isn’t doing well.  I’m pretty certain that she’s on her last leg.  Yesterday she was ok—not great, but was at least walking around—she even pooped all over the house yesterday morning.  Today though, she’s just been laying around.  She got up for a second this morning when i called her, but didn’t really want to move.  She also didn’t want to leave her pen.  I took her food out to her, and she ate a couple bites, but then was done.  

When i put her back in her pen, she immediately fell over—like somersault fall over, and then she just stayed there.  It’s a little cold out now, so i picked her up and took her into the trailer with me so she could stay warm.  Once she laid down in there, she didn’t really budge the rest of the day.  

She’s not complaining, but if she keeps going at the rate she has been (like progressively worse by the minute it seems—certaininly noticbly by the day), then it’s going to be soon.  It was just two nights ago that I was telling Keith she wasn’t doing well but that I think she can make it to Christmas and the hope is that she could make it to the new year—too many have been lost in 2020.  But now, today, i called Keith and told him, I don’t think she’s going to make it to the weekend.  It’s really a terrible disease, and i so wish she could tell me what she wanted.  Yesterday I confirmed that she was still wagging her tail at least, which i felt was a good sign, but there was none of that today.

It’s just so fast.  

As for the server, well, it’s mostly done, but then i broke it—go figure.  I’m trying to sort that out, and will hopefully have it sorted by stand up tomorrow.  I had all but one test fully passing before it broke, and now they are all just spinning and thinking. Argh!

This time around though, it was all easier, more fluid, and made a lot more sense.  There wasn’t a sense of rushing and I’ve pretty much finished it in a third of the time and in a much cleaner fashion.  But i still need to write the README as well as figure out the jars.  *Sigh…*

Rex:  
Keith is fixing his car and currently has all the tires off.  Rex saw it and immediately pointed out that the “tires fell off of daddy’s car”. He then told me that he needs batteries so that he can fix them and that he was going to put them back on.  A short time later, he told Keith that he needed a screwdriver and that he would put them back on with said screwdriver.

Smart kid.  He knows he needs tools to fix stuff and he knows that batteries are often the fix to things—i have no doubt that he has next to zero concept of what a battery actually is, but hey, he knows broken things often need batteries, so why not tires?

Leo:  
Leo is a carnivore.  He ate all his dinner and then he saw that i was eating steak.  He screamed to get down from his high chair, and then came over to me and said “up!”.  The first time around, I thought he was just wanting me, so Keith took him to play basketball while I ate, but he broke free and came back to me.  So i picked up him.  Then he demanded my dinner, so i gave him little bites and he demanded more.  This kid ate like half of a giant filet—he may have eaten more than me.  And with every bite he would make a chomping noise and then look at me, say “Mmmm!”, and sign for more.

Yesterday, while Leo was nursing—yes, he still nurses like once or twice a day—i looked down at him.  He gave me a scowling look, reached up, and pushed my face away.  I looked back down at him, he unlatched, glared at me for a moment, and said “dawh-ooo” before rewatching.  It was as if to say “don’t look at me”.  So naturally, I looked at him again, and in a more angry tone he did the same thing.  I repeated this several times, and each time he got more frustrated and pushed my face away again.  Normally, i would not intentionally try to irritate a baby, but I was a little involved in his eating process, so I figured i was allowed.
