I did it!  Today is a much better day than yesterday, granted i wasted a bunch of time working on the commandLine code that I’m not sure I actually need, but I will still be able to use the algorithms that I wrote.

I have to say that at a couple points today, i was really missing clojure.  When it came to separating out the array in java, yikes, what a pain!  I had to import new libraries and type a bunch of ugly keys—what’s with the alligator brackets in java?!  Can’t we just call it a list and be done?!  Don’t get me started on declaring a new array and having to type everything twice: String[] blah = new String[of this many] followed by blah[0] = blah, blah[1] = blah blah.  That’s so many keys to type, and it’s ugly.  But then to separate them out?!  Omg, from what i found i had to import the list library, turn it into a list, then write another messy functions to see if it contained items, and yikes, it was an ugly mess!  With clojure it’s so nice:  (contains? blah blah).  That’s it!!  Three words!  Plus a meaningful, functional question mark.  

Anyway. My server works—at least in the sense that it connects and prints my header.

I actually didn’t get my “aha!” moment until the very end of the day after I was already pushing it to pick up the boys.  But then suddenly I got it, and with it, things suddenly make sense!  I was so focused on having an HttpServer class or object or something, and then i realized that the entire package *is* the server (I’m also impressed that as I write this, i’m writing my fonts and whatnots in markdown language—it’s not much different than regular typing actually—instead of highlight and pushing control “I”, i simply encircle the item with *stars/**).  From that point, when i realized the entire thing was the server and I suddenly knew how to make it talk through the server, i had a river of ideas and solutions coming in. I even deleted my original HttpHandler and HttpCommandLine and rewrote them all, and I did it in like 15 minutes!!!  Granted I used the same tests from before, because, well, they weren’t completely wrong.  After 15 minutes, i started the server and then a browser and instead of getting a big fat “you’re an idiot”, i got a smiling “Gina’s Http Server”!!!  Plus the other stuff.  

Tomorrow, I will work on making the tests pass.  Everything is due Monday.  I started warning Keith Wednesday night, that unless he was needed at his plant, I would probably need to work this weekend, and thus i plan to.  We’ll see how far I get tomorrow.  I’m probably going to shut this blog off now, and work a little more—but I can’t lie, slither.io is calling me (still!).  But no!  Focus Gina.  Get the server to work!  Then I can do so much more!

Rex:  
Rex has been asking for breakfast at the table recently.  It used to be that every morning he would storm into our room demanding squares and milk on the couch immediately.  But lately, he’s pleasantly come the room, crawled into bed next to, and when it’s time to get up he tells me, “mommy, i don’t want to wake up yet.  Can we snuggle?”  “Um...YES!!  Of course we can snuggle!”  So we lay for a few minutes, and then he asks for a pancake or peanut butter bread At. The. Table!

After which, he’s been super pleasant all week with getting ready for school.  Every morning, we play “can you get your head in this hole” (being the head hole of his t-shirt) and can you get your foot in the sock?  He finds these games hysterical! Of course I also move the items out from under him a lot to play along and make it harder, and he laughs and laughs.

Leo:  
And every time Rex sings, Leo dances!  Actually Leo did something really cute and impressive tonight.  He was wandering around and went into the bathroom.  When i found him, he was on Rex’s step with my blush brush in one had and my mascara tube in the other hand.  I asked him what he was doing, and he proceeded to dip the blush brush into my closed compact and brush it on his face and then took the mascara tube and horizontally brushed it over his eye and forehead.  This was impressive, because i don’t think I’ve put make-up on in front of him in quite a while, yet, he kind of demonstrated the basic concepts of what each tool was used for.  Then he found his toothbrush and kept that in his mouth until bed.
