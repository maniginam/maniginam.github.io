Title: Click Bypass
date: 2021-02-24
---

I didn’t finish it today, but what’s really frustrating is that I know how to write the code and make it work.  It’s the tests that I don’t really know how to make work.  I spent a little time trying to get the click! function to work, but had to install the page and load it, and i understand why, but I struggled to get it to work.  So for the time being my tests bypass click by just calling the function that click would otherwise call.  

By the end of the day, i was able to get all the correct rooms showing again--i’d messed that up at some point and caused it to call the same room the same number of times as the correct count of rooms.  That was annoying--and caused by trying to get the click to work. Fixed that and moved on to getting the room-display column to show up on click.  That was cool.  I’ve got the room name displaying, but still need to get the users & stories updated.  

Not a horrible day, but i do need to get better at writing tests.  There is a lot of information out there on how to write code, but not really a ton on how to write good & all-covering tests.  

I’m going to see if I can get a little more done before i call it a night.  Talk to you tomorrow.
