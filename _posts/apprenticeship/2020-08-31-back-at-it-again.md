Today I spent a good while meeting with my brother.  Overall, i think it was a very worthwhile meeting for me.  I was able to explain to him that while I understand the concept of the OPC principle for the most part, I’m still really struggling to apply it--especially in clojure since all examples out there are for java and procedural languages.

He reminded me of multimethods--which I wanted to kick myself for, because i think it was just yesterday or saturday where I’d been looking through my koans for examples of defprotocls & defrecords, and ran across multimethods.  I thought to myself, “i bet i could use this instead of defprotocol”, but then immediately moved on.  I also remembered that being one of the harder koans for me at the time too, but in looking back, it makes total sense now.  

I put it into practice immediately in ttt, and well, digging through old code to fix it and decouple it, isn’t exactly easy.  I need to figure out where to use it, because I don’t think I want to use it for everything.  I’ll get there…  

Overall, it was a good day, and I’m back at it full time again now, so that will be nice.  I also get to join some cleancoders meetings this week.  That will be very interesting for me.  Despite it being a small meeting, I’m still a little nervous...
