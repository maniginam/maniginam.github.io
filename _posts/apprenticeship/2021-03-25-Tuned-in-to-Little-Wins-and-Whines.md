Title: Tuned in to Little Wins & Whines
date: 2021-03-25

I discovered something very interesting this week.  When my boys cry at night or ever, I hear them immediately.  I will wake up from a deep sleep before they are even able to complete their first cry (most of the time).  I was frustrated at first this week, because my intent was to help out my brother & sister-in-law, and I’d wanted to help get up with baby and maybe even do a night feeding.  

Even when sitting with both of them while little Isla napped, they could both be on their feet making moves to get a bottle or get the baby, before I’d even realize she was crying.  It’s not that I couldn’t hear her, it’s that I’m not tuned to her.  It was very weird.  Only once have I woken up to her crying at night—and my room is across the hall and my door has been opened most nights.  That was last night.  Perhaps I’m becoming tuned to her cries.  I found this instinctual alertness & responsiveness very interesting.

It also helps me to understand why no one else hears my boys when they cry at night.  This used to frustrate me, but perhaps it’s just because no one else is tuned to them, and I can’t blame them for that.

Now, when you are not quite tuned to the library that you are trying to use in order to integrate an app into another platform, life must become about celebrating the little wins.  

Did the button show up?  Yes.  (Yay!).  
Did it work when you clicked it?  “No, but it showed up!”  
Did it work when you clicked it after making some thoughtful changes?”  “Yes! The pop up came up!”  
“Did the pop up show what it was supposed to?”  “No, it had an invalid url error, but it showed up!”

Because it showed up, progress has been made!  Not nearly as much as I would have liked, but it’s a lot more than yesterday anyway.

Rex:  
When Rex is on FaceTime, he always likes to report out exactly what he’s doing that moment (tonight it was watching Bluey) and what he ate for dinner (pizza—I could have guessed that one).  

Leo:  
Leo is always so happy to see me on FaceTime when I call.  He blows me all the kisses and shows me stuff that he finds.  He tries to talk to me also, but can’t quite find the words to say.  He’s gotten bigger.
