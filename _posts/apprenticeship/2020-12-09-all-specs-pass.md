I missed a couple of days writing.  On Monday, Rex & I travelled by commercial airline up to Minnesota.  It was kind of on a whim, but for good reason.  I can’t remember if I’ve mentioned my brother-in-law & sister-in-law’s situation on here--I know i’ve started a couple posts about it, but I don’t know if I ever posted them.  I won’t get into the details now either, but they are suffering through an unfathomable tragedy, which is the loss of their 22.5 week pregnancy.  I felt for her so much that Keith and I decided that maybe I should be here to support them even if I don’t even see them--just in case.  At the last minute, I decided to bring just Rex too. 

Anyway, so Monday I worked right up until my must-leave-the-house-now time and still had to pack both myself & rex.  They were calling last call as we were running to the airport.  On the airplane, i worked more, but honestly completely forgot to blog about it.  

So what have I been working on?  The server, and finally today, it works!  All of it!  I’m going to keep working on it a little more tonight to try to clean it up some, because it’s kind of a mess.  

As I was dismantling and regrouping yet another header string, i really wanted to just carry the one piece of information forward to the next function, and almost added it as an argument, but then I thought, “hmmm, i know how to make maps in java now, why don’t i just turn the entire request into one big map and plop that around instead of a string that repeatedly needs to be deconstructed and reconstructed?”  That took more time than I wanted it to, but I was much more at ease about the whole system once that was done. Now i had all the information anywhere I needed it without having to re-search for it.  I don’t know why I hadn’t done that in the beginning, as that is 100% how i would have done it in clojure.  I guess it was just the shock of getting used to java.

After that, I made a couple more tweeks to add to the map, and then suddenly, viola!  All the specs passed!

Rex:  
We took Rex to a christmas light show this evening.  As soon as he looked out the window and saw the lights he said “Mommy! Look at the lights!  They are amazing!”

Leo:  
I’ve called Leo every night since we’ve been gone, and he is always just so smiley to see me.  When i blow him kisses over facetime, he puts his hand to his mouth, smacks his lips, and sends one back.  It’s very cute.
