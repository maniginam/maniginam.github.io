It happened again where i let time get away from me again while working on an algorithm to stop at the end of the day, think about the problem again later, and realize in seconds what I should have done.  It’s just so hard to stop when you’re in the middle of [failing/trying] to find a solution to a problem.  

Today it was game of life.  I spent way too much time on that today.  It’s not a bad thing necessarily as I got some good practice in thinking through the problem and letting the tests lead me, but that of course got away from me too.  I find that I can follow TDD at the start of a problem no sweat, but once i get into the core part of it, i lose track of the tests.  I did solve it finally, but now that I know the answer, it will go better tomorrow.

Tomorrow i will also need to spend some time working on my presentations and filing the game away.  Additionally, i need to spend some time putting in some good effort toward writing a meaningful & relevant blog instead of my normal writings which are really just journal entries.  

I’ve also been reading the clojure book every night before bed until Leo wakes me up and insists i don’t read with his demands to play with my iPad if the light is on.  I’ve been learning a lot from reading that actually.  Amazingly, something i hadn’t thought to do until now, is just read through the clojure library to get a better understanding of what functions are available.  That would probably go a long way—I mean you can’t communicate efficiently if you don’t have a broad vocabulary, and similarly, you can’t really code efficiently if you don’t have a broad functional vocabulary.

That’s it for now, i guess.  Off to watch the debates!  This surely will be an exciting election...
