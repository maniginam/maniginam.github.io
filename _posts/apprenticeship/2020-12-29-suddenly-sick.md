As I mentioned, both my boys were sick last night.  Shortly after, Keith came up and wasn't feeling at this top game and then proceeded to throw up.
He stayed in bed all day today feeling awful.  Rex was back to 100%, but Leo was a little off.  I felt weird but
I didn't feel nauseous, so i worked on through it until about 445pm, when suddenly it hit me.  I packed up my little office,
made an appearance in the kitchen, and was in bed just before 6pm.    

Today, I got my form to work and am continuing to work through that.  I have it possible to select the player count as well as
set the board size, so more progress; not where I'd like to be but, I'm working at it.  Hopefully tomorrow I won't be a complete
disaster and unable to work...
