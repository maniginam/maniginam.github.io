Marco was a dud, but Laura is anticipated to be, well, this is what the national hurricane center says:  ...POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC STORM SURGE, EXTREME WINDS, AND FLASH FLOODING EXPECTED ALONG THE NORTHWEST GULF COAST TONIGHT... ...STEPS TO PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY SHOULD BE RUSHED TO COMPLETION IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS…

So we will see.  We are pretty much prepared.  All stuff locked away & the generator has been tested.  Marco kept me home with the boys on Monday & Tuesday.  I was surprised that school reopened today, but I anticipate it being closed again tomorrow.

Changing topics, although it is getting windy in this trailer now, I just got off the phone with my vet.  I learned that our first dog, Brusly, a 5 year old Rottweiler, has lymphoma.  She was just at the vet in mid may soon after my return home from my covid travels, when she was a perfectly healthy & happy rottie.  On Friday, i noticed that her eyes had blue-d and were hazy, so I took her to the vet; now she has probably 2-3 months--6 is very uncommon.  She’s a good dog.  

After hearing about Brusly, I also became a dud.  I was able to clean up my euler 14 a bit and work on cleaning my ttt tests up.  I’ve also done some research into the OCP.

Rex:  
It took Rex until recently to understand that Brusly could be played with and to be ready to play with her.  It was only like 2 or 3 weeks ago when Keith & taught him how to play with her.  Then he threw a toy for her over & over again, and he loved it!  And she played!  Her eyes were fine then.

Yesterday he was begging to play with her again, so I told him to get a toy and throw it, but she didn’t want to play and, in fact, she seemed irritated by him and was growling a little bit.  Signs that she’s not herself, so I let her hide in her kennel.  Rex ran up to her kennel and said “I love Brusly”. <3

Leo:  
Again, I feel like it was just last week, maybe the week before, where Leo was crawling all over Brusly.  She had a bone, so we were watching them, but every time she moved, Leo would crawl right over to her and climb on top of her laughing & laughing.  I mentioned to Keith that night that I’ve always thought that Tails would be Rex’s best friends (aside from Bobby of course) for whatever reason, and that as I watched Leo & Brusly, I could see those two being best friends and getting along really well.  We’ll let him know.
