So for the past couple of months, dare I say, Amazon prime video has had a bug.  No matter what device and no matter whose profile was previously watching, when we go to play a different show (maybe even a kid’s show), the most recent show watch starts to play.  

This is especially dangerous with a 2 year old.  Imagine watching a very adult show one evening, and then in the morning when your kid wants to watch Stinky & Dirty or Blippi or Brain Candy, you select the desired show, then the episode, and then push play, only to find that some inappropriate show begins to play in front of your child.  

Obviously, i noticed the bug immediately with one of their last updates.  New in my field, i immediately took note of it, and had even noted to write about the bug.  As i mentioned, however, it’s now been a good 2 to 3 months.  I can’t imagine Amazon does not know about this bug, and I’ve questioned why they haven’t fixed it.  

While my dad was here, he taught me about databases and the dangers or updating a database vs event sourcing, and when I mentioned this bug to him, he described to me that update bugs are very hard to find.  So I’ll give that credit to Amazon, that maybe their bug is really hard to find, but I’m not willing to give too much credit.  A company with as much power and breadth as Amazon should really be testing their code and ensuring bugs like this don’t happen.

I guess my point is that this is ultimately a pretty harmless, even if annoying, bug, but it’s not without impact.  It’s actually a little—maybe even very—scary when you think about it that a company like Amazon could be so careless to let a this consumer impacting bug through their most recent update.  What’ s

shoot, i got pulled away from this one, and didn’t finish it….
