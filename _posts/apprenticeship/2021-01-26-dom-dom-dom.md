Title: DOM DOM DOM...
date: 2021-01-26

Every time I got on a roll today, my phone would ring, and because we are getting ready for a move, I had to break concentration each time to answer.  Some times it was the movers, sometimes the mortgage lady, sometimes the title company, some times a different moving company that wanted to quote us, and then don’t get me started on swapping the utilities.  Here in WBR, you have to physically go to the utilities office—even amidst the spread of covid.  I asked whyI have to go in.  Because we have to leave a deposit—that is not a reason!  And of course, i don’t have to tell you what times they are open to the public for setting up utilities—yup M-F 8-5, except for 1 hr between 11-12 for lunch.  Like really?!

Anyway, I had one test passing going into the day.  I had to spend some time figuring out reagent & react and the DOM structure and why it kept telling me that my target container wasn’t a DOM.  

After all the phone calls and the day, I finally had another test passing and the setup actually moving forward, which was a relief—it even shows up correctly in the browser, so yay!
