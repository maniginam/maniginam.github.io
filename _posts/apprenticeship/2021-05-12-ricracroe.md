This past year, I’ve gotten a little more enthusiastically into investing.  Perhaps it’s due to the ironically & unexpected bull markets we’ve been experience ever since the on-set of covid in our nation, or perhaps it’s due to having brothers who understand crypto, or perhaps it’s simply because I have a little more time…  That one is kind of a joke, because I don’t really have any more time than I used to, but i no longer have a lengthy commute--except to school & back--and i no longer have a 7am meeting, which allow me to check the markets first thing in the morning.

Last year I was more into stocks, but still not ‘actively’ trading.  Am I actively trading now?  Meh, not professionally by any means and I’m not very good at it, but I do watch it, analyze it, and look for correlations and potential events.

Today was a bad day--i’m down nearly 10% for the day.  Days like today are not the most fun, but they call for buy-time, which is always exciting and nerve-wrecking--things are down, what if they go more down?!  That’s where the trend lines along with a little bit of discipline go a long way.

Today is my second niece’s 17th birthday, and I just pulled out the first of what will be my gifts to all my nieces & nephews going forward--a silver coin.  This one is a zodiac coin with some white sketching around a metallic & artistic image of a bull--Taurus (just like me).  It has a minted value of 5 tokelau, so even if silver becomes so Earthly abundant to the extent that it becomes essentially worthless, this coin has a bottom fiat-value of 5 tokelau, which is worth about $0.72USD.  Tokelau is a New Zealand currency and the currency of the Tokelau islands, which are located between Hawaii & New Zealand.

It’s a beautiful coin, and I think that silver coins are a pretty cool gift.  Her mother, my sister, will understand the value of a silver coin and appreciate that kind of gift, because precious metals do tend to appreciate and are a good hedge against poor market conditions.

I haven’t really written much about money or investing on here just out of, i don’t, fear(?), to say too much about myself, but this is a pretty coin.  It is a coin she can choose to keep and pass along or choose to sell for the value of silver if the need ever arises.  While I hope she’ll keep it forever in a safe place, I certainly don’t have any expectations of her holding, if a time comes when silver is crazy high and/or she needs the dollar.  But it is pretty…  I think it’s a good gift.  Maybe she’ll appreciate it; maybe she won’t.

Today, i refactored my trello js til I dropped--that doesn’t necessarily mean that it can’t be refactored further, but I dropped, because the script kept failing to make good on it’s promises…

Then I met with Micah, and showed him what I’d done.  It all went down, for my first time, pretty well.  There weren’t any unexpected bugs--a couple things that didn’t go as originally scoped, but even those were expected because the scope changed last week.  After showcasing what I’d done, I received two new trello stories for next week and a new challenge.

My new challenge, specifically, is ***dun dun dun*** tic tac toe!!!  I should have seen that coming.  Though, speaking of precious materials, this time tic tac toe will be in the form of aluminum oxide after having been trapped under immense amounts of pressure for a long period of time.  

Ruby.
