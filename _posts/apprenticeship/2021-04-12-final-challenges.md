Title:  Final Challenges 
date: 2021-04-12
---

I got my final challenges today.  I was actually slightly relieved after getting them as I thought for sure I was going to have to build another HTTP server or something even more complicated that I never knew was a thing.  

I was about to describe what they were, but they are secret from future apprentices, so I suppose I shouldn’t.

Now, i may have been relieved that it wasn’t an HTTP server, but this still won’t be a cake walk.  It’s going to take a lot of time.  Today wasn’t great either.  I won’t embarrass myself over my stupid mistakes, but it’s after midnight and I should probably get to sleep to be better equipped tomorrow.
