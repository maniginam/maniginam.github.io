Alright, so this morning’s post didn’t count as my actual post.  That was more of a recounting and venting of this morning’s events.  

So today was a frustrating day.  I got everything for the different size boards essentially working, which i know because when i tried a 2x2 board or a 1x1 board, they worked flawlessly.  I was fully expecting the 4x4 to work, but it didn’t!  Argh!  At first i thought it was because the mini-max was just taking too long, but when i wrote a test for a 4x4 board starting with a full board and taking one box away at a time, it worked up until 10 boxes were open, at which point it did take nearly 2 minutes to calculate.  I thought maybe it’s the score mechanism using 10 & -10 as the max and min points, so I tried 100.  Still didn’t work.  

I’d spent long enough on that for the day, which was an hour or so more than I thought it would require, so I decided to pause and think about it some and change gears to make sure that it was at least printing correctly in the GUI.  Of course, yesterday I changed my board style from a map to a vector, so i knew there was work to be done there in the GUI.  

When i went to run the GUI though, it wouldn’t work!  I kept getting a ClassNotFound error.  But it was actually a BuiltinClassNotLoading.  I googled it with no success, and after about 2 hours, i finally caved and asked for help.  Got the GUI executing, but my dumb-butt had made changes to some of the drawing calcs while it wasn’t working, so the whole board was skewed.  I spent the rest of the day fixing that.  Very frustrating.

While I did make some progress, today ultimately felt like a lost day.  Tomorrow should be better.

Rex:  
Rex has started to act out when he’s angry now.  He knows he gets in trouble when he hits, so he’s changed his outburst into ‘bulldozing’, which after doing, he pretends was a funny joke.  It’s not.  ‘Bulldozing’ is where he runs at you with his head down, and slams his head into your leg.  It hurts!  This was an event of this morning, where he was mad at me because i put a shirt on him, so from about a 10 foot distance, he bulldozed me.  I think i have a Rex’s-head-sized bruise on my thigh now.

Leo:  
Leo tonight enthusiastically ate all of his dinner, so i offered him more.  He took what i gave him, squished it all in his hand, and then began throwing it on the floor.  The dogs, of course, love when Leo eats dinner, so they surrounded him, and he spent the rest of his dinner laughing at feeding it all to the dogs.  This was actually very entertaining to watch.
