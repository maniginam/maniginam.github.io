Happy birthday to Keith!

I like the flow of the estimating with poker cards.  I was pretty structured today, except euler12 is impossible and the answer has an impossibly big number…  I spent a lot of the morning on that with some success, but no answer yet…  it’s a big number…

Once i gave up on that, i worked on allowing for human v human, computer v computer, & human v computer play on TTT.  That was actually about as simple as I was hoping it would be.  I was mostly worried about having to change a lot of the code, but the truth is, is that when i set it up originally to do tests, i set it up for human v computer & computer v computer, so I really just had to add the option to play in the different ways and a little logic to make it do that.  Not bad.

I really wanted to work on difficulties after that and even more so, getting the GUI to work, but that is not what my customer asked me to work on this week, so I stuck to the agenda and went back to euler 12 with a new thought(!!!)--didn’t work…  argh.  Tomorrow, as new kata.

Rex:  
The past several days, Rex will prompt me with “Mommy?”  “Yeah Rex?”  “I don’t know.”  “Well, okay. I guess I don’t know either.”  “You don’t know?”  “Nope, i don’t know.”  “I don’t know either.”  “good talk Rex.”

Leo:  
Leo get sooo excited when he does ‘bye-bye’.  He cracks himself up.  I’ll say bye to someone, then he’ll wave, and then he’ll just smile so big and with so much pride until he starts laughing at his accomplishment!
