Title: Stubborn GUI
date: 2020-11-12
---

More travel for this crew.  Keith, Rex, Leo, and I are all piled into a car with two of our friends as we ride to Galveston.  We rented an expedition, so that we could all ride together for the drive, but when we picked it up, they gave us a pathfinder, which hardly had enough room for all of our stuff considering we have two car seats, a pack-n-play, a stroller, and all of our bags.  

After a little tetris, we somehow made it work less the stroller.  We need a new umbrella stroller though anyway, so maybe we’ll buy one and somehow have more room on the way home.  After having eaten roast beef sandwiches from Arby’s, Rex & Leo are now currently happily and sleepily both watching Brain Candy.  Well, Rex might not be watching sleepily, he’s actually pretty animated when he gets excited about something he’s watching.

Today, i worked on finalizing ttt some more.  I wrote some new tests for the GUI where i found some bugs with the game-restart and the message-key.  

Then i messed more with figuring out how to get the GUI to play from main.  Still no luck.  I don’t think it’s possible.  I’ve tried everything.  Something about class not found, even though, it has no problem finding the class when I run it with the run button…. Oh well.  Everything is passing, i have a lot of good/better tests than I’d had, and everything is much cleaner.

Hopefully tomorrow, Micah will approve, and I can get my next assignment!

Rex & Leo:  
As a follow up to yesterday, I wanted to mention that this morning at school, i took them to the other side, let Rex play with the trucks and the pebbles for a couple minutes while holding Leo, then walked them up front the long way, and both of them went pleasantly and willingly to school.  Hopefully that crisis has been averted, but we will see on Monday.
