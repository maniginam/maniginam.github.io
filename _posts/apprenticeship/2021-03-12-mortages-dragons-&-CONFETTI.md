Title: Mortgage, Dragons, & CONFETTI!!
date: 2021-03-12
---

We closed on our previous home this afternoon (after sitting in traffic for--well, almost forever causing us to show up 40 minutes late).  But yes, that place is no longer ours and it is off our books!  Yay!  

It was annoying though, because all contracts say that closing will take place at a title company of the buyer’s choice.  Well in this case, our buyer’s (with no blame on them as I would have done the same), chose to close at the same title company as their buyers so they could do it all in one go.  But their buyers, despite living near us, allowed their lenders to choose the title company, which just so happened to be on the other side of the world from West Baton Rouge.  

But that wasn’t what was annoying.  No, it was the lenders chose this place.  We had a time of yesterday at 10am scheduled since early last week, and then their lenders ‘forgot’ an article, and at the last minute yesterday, when they realized, had to push back closing by a day and move it to 3PM today.  Between 3PM & 6PM, it is advised that you avoid crossing the bridge on any given day, but on Friday, just don’t cross it, because the traffic is always backed up (before we moved to this side, while i worked over here, it once took me 2 hours to go 12 miles, and while that is a little uncommon, and hour and a half is not.  So we moved).

What’s frustrating is that our buyers’ buyers’ lender, who made a mistake and forgot to do their job, cost us an additional 2 hours of our time as well as an extra day of interest because they messed up.  In the long run, it’s not that big of a deal, but that was an expense mistake with no one to complain to.  

Anyway, we made an evening out of it and go some dinner and went to them *movies*!  We should have seen a zombie movie, as that’s kinda how it felt.  There was no one there.  Like two employees and only two other people in our theater--and this is coming from someone who used to love going to the movies by herself on a saturday afternoon.  It was weird, but it was Leo’s first movie and Rex’s first capable-of-memory-movie.  We saw Raya and the Last Dragon, which was actually both beautiful and awesome--I think we may plan a trip to phuket this year (it was not set there specifically, but it was certainly Thailand or southeast asia--there was a floating village, and we’ve been there).  

Anyway, today was fun at work.  I got right to confetti, which i was kind of at a loss for.  I made a deliberate move early though, and suddenly a rectangle appeared.  

Alright, something is happening.

Deleted the rectangles, and noticed some errors, made fixes, and suddenly, a bunch of black ‘sparkles’ appeared! Yay!  I’m done!  

Not quite.  A couple more tweaks and the sparkles got their color!  And then a gradient color!  Ooh!  Things are exciting!  But they were stationary.

I’m still not actually sure what I did that got them to move--i might have been behind on a refresh.  But suddenly they were moving all at the top of the screen making a rather soothing wavy, motion--my y update was wrong, obviously.  

Fixed that, and I had streamers falling to the bottom of the screen.  It was a thing of beauty, but also one that never ended despite the fact that they were out of view.  

I allowed the streamers to stay put for a little bit while I created a stop function.  This was a test as it’s impossible to see if sparkles are still falling once they are off the screen.  

Then, I cleared the canvas prior to every new drawing, and suddenly, CONFETTI!!!!  Sparkles falling everywhere!  Oh, it was so pretty!  Then i left to sign our previous home away.  CONFETTI!!!

All that’s left is making the server push this effect--and of course some clean up...

Rex & Leo:  These two, Leo who has never stepped foot into a movie theater and Rex who has never had the memory capacity to remember having been in a movie theater, did awesome!  

Leo, was in my lap.  He watched the opening, non-speaking, pixar short at the beginning.  Then the movie came and with that, voices.  When talking started, he jumped and started looking around trying to figure out where they came from.  I held him and comforted him, and he soon relaxed and continued to watch the entire movie despite it being past bedtime.  He just sat in my lap and watched.  

Rex, did similar.  He sat there the entire time and watched it.  I think he got scared a couple times as there were some fighting scenes, but he was very good.  

With about twenty minutes left, they were done and wanted to climb the stairs.  Fortunately, there were only 2 other people in the theater--one of which was a child, so I didn’t really stop them.  

I asked Rex if he liked the movie.  He said no, but when we got in the car, he said, “Mommy, i want to see the dragon movie again!”
