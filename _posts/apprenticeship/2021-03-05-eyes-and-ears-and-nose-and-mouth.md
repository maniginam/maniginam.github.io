Today came & went.  My morning started with the home-warranty people calling me (yet again) because i’d given them my email address & true phone number the first time I was looking at it--we are required under contract to purchase a home warranty for our buyers.  These people are relentless with calls & emails.  Not only do they call four times a day, they do this in two back to back phone call sets.  Once in the morning and once in the evening.  But we are closing next Friday, so I need to actually talk to them now.  They keep lowering the price too which is weird and annoying--like just tell me how much it is.

Anyway, once all that was done, i got back to making the admin-authorization more robust.  It’s true what they say that more time is spent reading code than writing it--and i’m a slow reader.  Nonetheless, i think I finally have the flow of the whole site nailed down now, and I understand why there are multiple requests after each client request. 

Once I figured that out, what needed to be done snapped into place and was executed rather easily.  I fixed a few other things that needed to be fixed as a result of the former fix as well as put the main room container permanently on the screen instead of only after a room is activated, and then tried to figure out the whole cursor hover thing; i got that to work on the browser console, btu couldn’t quite get it within the clojure css, so I’ll ask Nick about it on Monday.  

Finally, i had a few short minutes to start reviewing confetti!  And i guess that’s it.

Rex:  
Rex starts Tball on Tuesday.  He is going to be sooooooo excited!!!!  He also thinks that his stuffed Hulk is a green Anger from Inside Out, but ironically (or appropriately) this makes him angry, because Anger is supposed to be red.

Leo:  
I mentioned the other night that Leo pointed to my ears and said “eeeaaawaa”.  He did it again tonight followed by prying his finger into my mouth, jamming his finger up my nose, poking each eye, and greasing up my glasses.  

Then Keith asks him where his hand is.  He wasn’t sure, so i pointed to his hand, and he held it up.  I showed him fingers and then repeated hand and said “High Five?”.  He gave me a high-five and cheered.  Then we repeated the parts of the face, starting with mouth, and he high-fived my mouth…  And cheered...
