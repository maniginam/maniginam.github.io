I feel like I’m almost there!  Although, i think I could have left everything the way I had it the first time around…  I’ve still ended up checking for wins by checking each possible win.  I guess that’s okay for now…

I’m on the algorithm, and then clean up!

Maybe by the end of the week, I’ll have something to show.  

That would be good timing as I think Friday is the day things at work become finalized.  

This is not a long blog as I don’t think I have much different to say from anything I’ve already said, since I’ve literally been doing the same thing over & over for the past couple of weeks.  And I don’t mean that to sound like boredom or anything along those lines; what I actually mean is a jab at myself in that I’ve literally been trying to solve the problem in different ways and end up doing it in the same way even after switching to a completely different language.  It’s a little perplexing and frustrating.  I keep doing the same things over and over with just little changes.  I don’t think I’ve tipped over the edge of insanity yet, but let’s give it another loop...

***
Rex:  
I was giving Rex a bath yesterday, and he pointed to his nipple and said “what’s that?”  “That’s your nipple.  You have 2 nipples.”  He replied very matter of factly, “No.  I don’t.  A dinosaur ate my nipples.”  What?!  I laughed.  He laughed as if he was a part of the joke.

Leo:  
I actually had Leo home with me today, because he was feeling great this morning.  He’s full on crawling now.  While I was trying to ‘work’, i gave him a box full of toys for him to investigate, and do you know what box he chose over that fun box of toys?  He escaped by enclosure to go check out the kitty litter box…  Little stinker (as Gramma would say, and this in case, pretty accurate).
