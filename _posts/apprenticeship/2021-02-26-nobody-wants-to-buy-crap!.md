Title: Nobody Wants to Buy Crap!

Well, I should probably stop for the day and write a little bit.  It’s amazing how you can spend the entirety of a day only to be exactly where you left off yesterday.  Okay, in a much improved spot as yesterday, but nonetheless, with the same task ahead of you.  Don’t get me wrong, today was actually very productive and I’m not disappointed with how it went other than this task is still not complete.

After our 9am standup call, we had a meeting with a prospective client.  That was fun and maybe even promising.  Then i got back to work on the admin page for poker.  Around noon-ish, micah pinged that he was free and able to review some of my code and tests--i’d mentioned my tests were not exactly robust.  He showed me how to maneuver the database a little more efficiently.  That helped a lot, and we got my rendered page to click!

I spent the rest of the day refactoring and actually clicking instead of mock clicking by setting click to the function that was to be called.  

By the end, as I mentioned, I ended up with all the rooms showing and displaying the users as active or not when clicked upon with the task of the stories still in front of me.

It is weird that I can feel good about a day where literally nothing more was produced, but the quality of the product was improved.  I guess this is not in line with “right the first time” or “first pass quality” from my previous life, but it does follow the standards of SQDIC.  Safety first & foremost.  Next is quality.  Third is delivery, also considered to be production.  It doesn’t matter how much you produce if everything or even just some of what you produce is crap.  Nobody wants to buy crap!  All thought after having been unpacking the last few week, i certainly have bought a lot of it...
