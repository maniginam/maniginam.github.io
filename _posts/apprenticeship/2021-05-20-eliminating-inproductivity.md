Title:  Eliminating Inproductivity
date: 2021-05-20

It’s funny how extremely productive tasks can feel like a lost time.  For instance, i hate sleeping--well, i hate bed time, but sleeping is actually one of the most important things a person can do.  It just feels like a total waste of time.

I spent the majority of the day estimating and building a proposal for my former-former company.  This was a very productive way to spend my time as I really think this one might go through, and if it does, that could be really huge.  This is a major company with several sites, so if this does go through and they are happy with it, this project could open up a lot of doors.  Plus, having a project like this on your resume will make opening doors at other similar companies a lot easier.

I’m really excited about this.  I mean, they sought me out, so they actually want this project implemented to some substantiated degree, and this is what I want to do.  This is again, my goal.  Building bridges over the rivers & canyons that prevent my former industry from being at a high standard or productivity and efficiency.  Eliminating the everyday tasks that take them away from doing truly value-added activities.  Don’t get me wrong, these tasks that are performed have immense value, but they can be automated!  Man-hours do not need to be spent on these tasks, and with software, the man-hours can be freed to improve instead of simply sustain.

So that was the majority of my day.  The rest of the day was spent on re-organizing my trello integration.  Speaking of, I actually used my work thus far to do the estimating today.  That was pretty cool--and(!!!) it saved me like 15 minutes of double entering the same information in two places.  That was pretty cool too!

I got it all working with the new implementation, but I hate it!  See, originally, i was just using the list & the card names to make adjustments to the stories, but doing it this way, i finally decided that what I really need to do is use the card ids--duh!  But that changes things.  It changes the production code as well as all my tests.  That’s okay.  I just wish I’d figured that out a little sooner.

Nonetheless, it was a good day.
