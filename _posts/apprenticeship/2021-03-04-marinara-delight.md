Title: Marinara Delight

Today was fine.  I reviewed my admin code with Micah, and while there were a lot of todos for fixes throughout, the majority of them were pretty minor in my opinion.  Everything worked, but somethings just needed to be cleaner.  I was not disappointed in the outcome.  

After our talk, i set forth on making those improvements.  I finished all but one (and some additionals) by the end of the day, so tomorrow, i will work on getting the server to pull the user info--just as I’d assumed it should be yesterday. Once that’s done and I’m happy with the final product, I get to make cljscript confetti out of javascript confetti!  That should be fun!

That’s all for now--Leo work me up at like 4:20 this morning, so I’m pretty pooped, but here’s a picture of him enjoying marinara sauce while Rex is on the slide:
