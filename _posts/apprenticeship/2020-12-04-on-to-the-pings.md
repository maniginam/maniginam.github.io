Happy Birthday Micah!!!!

For Micah’s birthday, i really wanted to complete the server, but instead i got half of one spec to pass.  I spent most of the day refactoring and re-writing code, because while I’d thought I’d been using all bytes, i was reading bytes endlessly with no end.  And i was only testing through my HttpHandler and not the whole server, so things hadn’t been working.  But I made a lot of progress today—even got a picture of Brusly to ‘upload’ to the ‘database’..  My code is looking better too (well, some of it), and getting the rest of that spec to pass shouldn’t be too much trouble.  Then on to the pings.  Those have to be easier than uploading a file right?

Once I’m done with this server, i really need to take like an hour to review it all and make sure i actually understand everything i made work, especially to understand which input/output streams do what.
