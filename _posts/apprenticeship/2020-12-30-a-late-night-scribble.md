Title: A Late Night Scribble
date: 2020-12-30

A lot has been going on…. I should probably get it all out, but for the privacy of my siblings and my sibling-in-laws, i feel like i shouldn’t share more than necessary.  

What i can say is that I’m completely heartbroken for both.  The events that both sides have had to go through are horrific and seem like nightmares that just won’t end—that no parent should ever have to go through.  I’ll be more open once permissions are granted.  

I just feel for them both right now.  

I’m having a hard time writing anything about myself or my tasks for the day as I’m swarming in this.  

Today, i was very sick in the morning, but after a quick two- three hour nap, I tried to power through and got my players form working.  I’m incredibly behind, but still am making all the progress that time alotts.  

I will be stuck tomorrow i think. Getting my GUI into a web app seems like an impossible task at this point, so i will let you know tomorrow how it goes.  For now, i am going to get some sleep and hope for a good end to this wierd & sad & hard year.
