Title: I Want to Help

The cookies were supposed to be easy!  And all in all, the cookies are pretty simple to implement & use, but more stings to parse, and all my tests got messed up because I’d set the whole thing up using a stupid atom.  

Well today, i finally got all the tests passing again, but the app still doesn’t work.  I need to redirect the request still.  Hopefully that will sort it all out.  

That’s it for now—I’m super tired.  I was trying to get this all working until about 2am last night to be ready for the morning, and then Rex Leo insisted I be woken up just before 6, and with Keith having worked nights all weekend and last night, he wasn’t there to help much or tag me out, so I’m a little exhausted. 

***

Rex:  
Today Rex asked me why he has to go to school. I told him because Daddy & I need to work.  He asked why we need to work.  I told him so that we can buy him a new house and toys and snacks.  He asked “you can buy me all of the toys?”  “Sure.  Oh and TV!  If we didn’t work, we couldn’t buy you tv to watch”.  “Mommy, I want to help you work.”  “Thank you Rex!  You can help me by going to school and learning as much as you can!”

Over the weekend during nap time, i put Rex in his room with no activities, hoping that a little boredom would allow him to actually nap.  I went in after hearing some noise about 15 minutes into nap time to find Rex in the middle of every article of clothing from his dresser spread all around the room—thrown into the air I’m sure.  I’d just separated, folded, & organized these clothes last week.

Despite my frustration, I somehow remained calm, and allowed for a very suitable natural consequence, that he couldn’t come out of his room until they were all put back in the drawers (i didn’t care about order or folding, i mean he’s 3; i just wanted them picked up).  I went back a couple of times, and helped a little, but as soon as he’d start goofing off, I’d leave, until one time that I’d left, he took it all very seriously.  When I went back, all but like 3 shirts were put away.  I was very pleased with him.  

Leo:  
Leo has been a little hug bug all weekend—all the hugs and all the randomly timed kisses I could ask for.  To Rex on the other hand, his affections are a little different.  He bit him once, and then the rest of the weekend proceeded to threaten to bite him.  Rex obviously responded scared & excitedly, which drove Leo to threaten more.  I finally had to remove the kid from the area to tell him not do threaten to bite.  

Leo also has another new job—feeding the dog.  It’s a job that I’d originally given to Rex, but Leo really wanted to do it.  So everyday now, Leo spends about 20 minutes scooping about 2-5 bits of kibble at a time from the tub in a cup and taking it to Tails’s bowl.  Tails has learned to wait until at least a couple scoops have been dropped to make it worth her effort to come for dinner.  Lol
