Title: A Little Lion’s Dog Nose

I’ve been procrastinating writing today.  Not sure why—might just be tired.  My in-laws were here this weekend, and I envy that my mother-in-law can be both a night owl & an early riser and still be in a pleasant mood and go about her day.  I’ve always thought that I’ve actually been the type that can manage on very little sleep, but as kids have come into play, I’ve realized that that is just not true.  Nonetheless, I am night-owl, and no matter how early I wake up or how tired I am, once the sun goes down, I am up.  And I’ve always hated bedtime.  Sleeping is bring and only feels good when it’s time to wake up too early.  

Anyway, yeah, my in-laws were here this weekend to help us organize and unpack some more—no, we are not unpacked yet—it’s only been 3.5 weeks.  They were a huge help and helped me get through one of the biggest tasks that had been ever multiplying in front of my eyes everyday—laundry & going through the boys clothes.

I think I mentioned probably two months ago now, how I’d spent a couple hours organizing and folding the boys’ clothes and putting them away to prepare for the move?  And then how during ‘boring’ nap time (we all hate bed/nap time!), Rex found the most fun thing to do in his room, which was to pull out all of my work and throw it up in the air...

Well, since then, i think I’d been avoiding re-doing it.  Plus i was going to have to sort through all the sizes again, because, you know, they are 1.5 & 3 years old so they grow out of stuff.  My MIL helped a ton with that, and we got all caught up on laundry such that I actually only have a relatively small pile in front of me to do tonight.  In a past life, Keith & I (and the boys if I’m honest), lived out of the dryer or best case, laundry baskets.  Laundry is a task, and there’s next to no immediate gratification from it because the pile never shrinks.  

Anywho, i’m not here to talk about laundry.  I’m here to talk about poker—the app anyway.  After yesterday, I decided to take my time and follow the request through receiving a response.  This is actually kind of hard, and it doesn’t feel linear—well not straightforward anyway.  

When Micah had a few minutes free, I met with him and I timidly told him what I was doing.  Fortunately, I was correct in my assessment yesterday that the server should serve the data required opposed to the client side pulling whatever it wants.  But I was still struggling with getting the data to the client despite it being printed in the console of the browser.  

I knew the problem though—it was the handler.  For whatever reason, and I’m sure this is one of those things that will be so obviously easy after I really understand it, but I could not figure out what the handler was supposed to look like.  In my defense, I guess I’ve never put a function into a map before.  That feels like a weird thing to do, but really it’s just instructions on what to do when called—like any program?  So a program in a program?  

I finally got it.  The right number of rooms are showing up with the correct number of users.  

All his code is so advanced, and while i can read it and even understand it for the most part, it is a little intimidating to work with and write around.  Like will i ever write like that?  I have to—that’s what’s expected, but it’s even the little things that I’ve never done.  It’s so easy to get into a comfort zone of what you know and then not trail out of that.  Interestingly once you are more advanced and know all the tricks and have confidence in your craft, it’s easy to forget about that initial comfort zone and perhaps over complicate rather easy things to do.  I should explain that because that obviously doesn’t make sense.  While i was pairing with Micah last week, I was writing the production code to his test.  I think I used the (str _) function along with a string and a map-get to put it all together, and he commented that it was interesting that I’d done that because he probably would have written an anonymous function.  

Anonymous functions weird me out…. especially when they are returned as a thing.

Rex:  
Rex got ice cream for breakfast again (i know, I’m a horrible mother to feed my child ice cream for breakfast, but for the record, he also had peanut butter toast & squares).  He earned his happy tower—he’s been getting more into it lately also.  

After ice cream, there was an excavator in our neighbor’s yard.  Oh man!  Have you ever seen an excited 3 year old before?  This kid squealed when I asked him if he wanted to go outside and see it, but he stopped me to say “But wait, Mommy!  I need to get my toy excavator first!”  “That’s right!  That would be awesome!  Go and get it!”  And so he carried his toy excavator out to meet the big digging excavator next door—we didn’t actually get to get close to it as the fence was in the way, but i found a hole in the fence for him to peep through.

I was surprised when I got back from dropping them off at school to see the toy excavator perfectly put back in the well organized parking of his trucks at his construction site (a dirt path in our yard):

Leo:  
Oh Leo.  This weekend, he had a little cold and was stuffy and had lots of boogers (yuck! I know...sorry, but just wait, it gets worse...). I wiped his nose pretty frequently and he made me a little uncomfortable with how much he liked getting nasal spray—like, he would sign for & say “more” each time and then laugh after getting sprayed.  Nasal spray sucks, so that was weird, but anything to clear the little guy’s nose out i guess. 

Anywho, despite my efforts to spray & wipe his nose all day on Sunday, he’d apparently built up a lot.  I looked at him at one point and exclaimed “Leo, why is your nose all black?!”  He looked like a dog.  I figured he’d gotten into mud or dirt or something or maybe a sharpee.  As I approached him, i realized it was fuzzy, and then i recalled him rolling in Tails’s bed.  This kid got enough dog hair stuck to his boogery nose to resemble a dog!  It was gross and hysterical.
