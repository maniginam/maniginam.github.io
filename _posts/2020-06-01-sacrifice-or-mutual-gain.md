So just a couple things to touch base on as I document this adventure.

First, I am excited to announce that I am almost done with my first run through all of the clojure koans!  This is very exciting.  I've also made some more improvements to my blog page, such as inserting a non-functioning email subscription input & button!  Very exciting stuff.  For now (and for looks) I think I'm going to just leave it there (it will actually get pushed with this blog post).  I'll leave it as a reminder to figure how to get that to actually work in the future.

The koans have been fun.  I can see how & why clojure is considered to be such a powerful language.  It just has abilities that make the readibility of the code a lot simpler if you understand the language.  I believe it also makes it more difficult to royally mess up a program, but I'm still learning this.  

I've also started reading Programming Clojure.  I haven't gotten very far, but I think this will be a good source for me going forward.
