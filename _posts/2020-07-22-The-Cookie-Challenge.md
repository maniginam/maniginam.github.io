I got the video in Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars working finally!!  It’s about time!  That’s been driving me nuts!  I also added a picture of Rex’s Racetrack to yesterday’s post.  At some point, I’m going to spend some more time on my website to clean it up & code it differently.  The tutorial I used to set this up was very good for when I was first starting out to get me going, but it didn’t really teach so much as instruct me to copy & paste things.  I got basic structures down and I think i understand how the html is working with markdown, but i think it can all be done a lot better and that I can add some other features/sections.  I also need to figure out how to include a next & previous button so I don’t have to go back to the main blog page to get to the next blog.  

I also made progress on TTT and i think i’m getting the hang of letting the tests drive the creation of code--that’s tough for some reason.  It’s easy to get caught up in just writing the code and forgetting about the tests.  It’s also cumbersome because I have to change the outputs of my tests pretty frequently--I feel like this telling me that I’m doing the TDD wrong and that really what I need every time i have to change a test is a new function.  I think I figured that out, and it’s going a little smoother now.

I’m hoping for more good progress tomorrow, but i spoke briefly with my manager this afternoon where he asked me to stop by tomorrow for what sounds to be a pretty serious conversation. My having to go into the office tomorrow, will likely halt my TTT progress some tomorrow, and while I’m still targeting the end of the week, it’s more than likely not going to be complete until next week now.

Rex:  
This past weekend I did the cookie challenge with Rex.  The cookie challenge is something that several moms have been posting on facebook lately where a mom places a single cookie in front of her toddler, tells the child she has to go poddy and to not eat the cookie until she returns, then leaves for up to two minutes, and finally returns to see what remains of the cookie.  The whole event is of course recorded, and I am very proud to say that Rex passed this test with flying colors.  Video evidence below.

Leo:  
Yesterday I mentioned how Leo yells at me.  At his 4 month doctor appointment, Leo was all smiles.  He smiled at the doctor and the nurses and anyone who would look at him.  Then the nurse with the shots came in.  He smiled at her.  She proceeded to poke him 3 times in his legs, he cried for a moment until I picked him up, at which point he looked at the poor girl standing in the doorway with a scowl on his face and started yelling at her over & over.  Like he was saying “WTF dude?!  That hurt!  I thought we were cool and then you poked my legs and it hurt!”, but it was actually coming out as “rawwwwr! Whhaaar!  Raaaahhhhwww!  Raaahhhahhhh!!”.  It was funny enough that the nurse actually stood in the doorway and just took it for a good minute--she even called the other nurses over.
