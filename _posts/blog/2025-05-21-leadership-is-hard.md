I just read my last post from 4.7.2022 and became saddened about the EPIC papers I'd drawn up, because until about 3 months ago, they were still in my backpack--you know, for safe keeping.  I finally took them out and decided it was time to save them and show them to the team.  Well, I decided to save them by way of lamination, only to then remember that I'd drawn them with a heat-sensitive erasable pen...  In that one decision, the original drawings of EPIC were gone...  Whoops.
