Go figure, night two of writing for my own benefit/from my own free will, I don’t feel like writing.

I feel like my writing should be much more professional or distinguished now that I’m officially a software craftsman--perhaps, i’ll stick with the term software developer to avoid the whole gender thing stemming from craftsman/craftswoman, which to be honest, I couldn’t care less about--but, back to the point, I feel like I have a tone already established, and distinguished as it may not be, it is my voice and thus I will stick with it.  If i try too hard, i’ll give up anyway…

There is a lot of poop in my life these days, but have you ever thought about the poop of a dragon?  Turns out they are as magical as you may have imagined and compiled of little bits of 1’s & 0’s.

A dragon poops each time you click on an element, proceed to drag it into or across a DOM, and finally drop it somewhere within an allowable component of said DOM.

So, these days, I am not only working on potty training Rex (as well as Leo--fingers crossed), but also my own personalized Night Fury, whom I call Epic, to both begin & end pooping where I want whichever creature I’m working with to do so.

Did you know dragons speak javascript?  Well, they do.  For me, this is an added challenge, because in the midst of a dragon drop, the trainer should ideally be able to witness every movement of the dragon to be sure the drop is positioned correctly.  If this doesn’t occur, things could get messy and even explosive…

I’ve seen dragon diarrhea at this point…  The whole screen goes blank and the browser must be refreshed--sometimes it’s even worse, so you really want to control your dragon every time he drops.

Good thing he’s cute!

Rex:
Rex is for the most part nearly completely potty trained now--it seemed to happen suddenly over the last week.  He was getting better and better but was still scared of the potty for a long while.  Suddenly at home, while scared at first, he came to terms and has repeatedly either peed in his potty or outside.  He may have peed on Bossbo--one of our three chickens--today also.  He tends to just whip it out and go whenever we are outside--a habit to break on a different day.

Leo:
Leo Meo got his second “m’s” & “b’s” in the last week.  Suddenly “Mah-ie” turned into “Mah-Mie!” and “Bah-ie” turned into “Bahb-ie!”.  The kid is however a magnet to mommy right now.  And he is the sort of magnet that when mommy is around, he is not only attached, but also freaks out.  When mommy is not in the room and thus there is nothing to attach to, he is apparently a perfect angel--but this is of course all hearsay, because I, myself, have never had the opportunity to witness this perfect child within my own absence.
