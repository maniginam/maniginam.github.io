Title: The Cutest Fight I’ve Ever Seen
date: 2021-04-20
---

Well, it was quite a week, and I am overall still exhausted from it.  16-20 hours in front of a screen frantically pushing buttons hoping that they turn out to be something to be proud of, is pretty draining.  Especially when you spent some much time on one of the requirements, leaving not enough time for another.  

Well, all that showed through in the end.  While I got decent feedback on the item i, regretfully, spent the least amount of time on, it was pretty obvious that it wasn’t as prepared as it could have been.  I think that showed even more because during some portions of it, i performed really well, so the times when I was lacking confidence stood out like the light was turned off mid show.  

Anyway, i don’t really want to talk about it all.  I’m disappointed in myself, i feel like i wasted everyone’s time, and I’m embarrassed, so yeah, i don’t really want to talk about it right now.  

Regardless, i received some good feedback for how to do better and what they are looking for, so I will aim for achieving that.

After all that was done, I picked the boys up a little early, and focused on spending the rest of the evening as high quality time with them, and then wine.  I was glad I chose to focus on them for some time, because--well it had been a while.  It was weird, I think i missed them more last week than I had in the week I was out of town and away from them.  Perhaps, because they were so close and I couldn’t really spend any time with them.  I could hear them cry for me, and had to stay away, because I knew if I went out, they would just cry more.

Rex:  
At one point, Rex told me this weekend that he was going to come help me work.  “Come on mommy, let’s go to work.  Follow me!”


Leo:  
Leo spent the evening putting bowling pins down on the floor and smashing (not rolling--he never let go of it) a ball against them to knock them down.

Then at some point, while he was fetching another pin, Rex ran through the two pins he’d just lined up so neatly.  Leo didn’t see Rex do this, so looked at the pins with a little confusion, but then he heard me fussing at Rex about it.  Leo put the two pins up again, and then Rex neared them.  Leo yelled at him and pointed for him to go away.  Rex spit his tongue at Leo.  So Leo spit his tongue at him, and they repeated this in turn probably 5 or 6 times each until Rex ran around the pins and said “Ha!” and Leo followed up with a “Ha!”  It was the cutest fight I’ve ever seen!

This evening, the boys got a little hide-out tee-pee tent from a friend of ours who no longer needed it.  Rex saw it and said “Wow!!” and ran up to it.  Leo followed suit exclaiming “Vow!!” and ran up to it.  Rex said, “It’s a secret, Mommy!” as he climbed in side--meaning that it’s a hide out spot.  It was cute.
