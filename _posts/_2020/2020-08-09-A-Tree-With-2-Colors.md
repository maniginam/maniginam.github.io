Weekends just don’t seem very productive.  I really need to get inside to relieve Keith & see the boys before bed.  I worked on euler 10 some more today--struggling a little with returning all diagonal vectors in a grid, but i’m close.

Then i worked on my website a little bit and even got a previous & next button on each post.  They work on the local port; hopefully they’ll work on the main page also.  

Tomorrow I’m home all day with the boys, so we’ll see how much they allow me to do tomorrow. My focus is going to be spending time with them and ensure that they have everything they need.  If they happen to nap together or play on their own for a bit, then i’ll pull out my computer.

Rex:  
Yesterday, while I was working, Keith gave the boys a “boat” to play in.  It was actually just a big amazon box, but still, they loved it.  He even gave them markers to color their boat with.  Rex scribbled some lines and said, “Look Daddy!  A tree!”.  Keith asked him if he could draw a tree with two different colors, so Rex picked up two markers in one hand, scribbled on the boat, and said “Look Daddy!  I did it!  A tree with two colors!”.  

Leo:  
The other night, Keith was eating flaming hot cheetos while we were watching our show.  Leo had of course woken up at around 930 to join us (he is in the leap of sequences).  He saw Keith eating and so crawled over to him to investigate.  Keith gave him a hot cheeto.  Leo used his very precise pincher grip to accept it from Keith, he put it in his mouth, I watched his eyes go wide as he grunted, then he shoved it in his mouth, and crawled back on top of Keith to reach for the entire bag.  He protested when I picked him up off of Keith until he was given another hot cheeto.
