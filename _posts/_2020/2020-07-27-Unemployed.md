Today was unexpectedly a little weird.  You see, for the past several weeks, I’ve been coming to my “office” (the trailer illegally per the HOA rules set up in our back yard), signing on to my work laptop, running my morning reports, attending my two recurring morning meetings, replying to emails, and then finally swapping my mind over to coding around 10am.  I’ve actually been slightly aggravated on a number of mornings that I was losing so much time in the morning to the company that was paying me (i’m laughing a little at that).  

Today though, i didn’t have a morning report to run and I didn’t have any meetings to attend.  I thought when this day came, I would be ‘free’, but instead, I found myself a little lost.  I didn’t know how to start my day…  

I came up with a plan that I think will work and that I think will most certainly be tweaked in the coming days & weeks.  First thing in the morning, I will get myself going with a ‘meeting’, except it will be a one sided meeting that expects nothing from me except my attention: a clean code video.  

By the time I have completed a video, i should have enough caffeine running through my veins to run through an euler problem and try some new functions in clojure.  As I’ve been going through those and TTT, i’ve been getting frustrated, because I think (and truly, i know) there are a lot more functions out there than those of which I know.  I think it would be a good exercise to try to use or at least apply/try one new function each day just to expand my ‘vocabulary’ and pump my coding muscles. Soon enough, this should force me become familiar with the ‘scary’ and intimidating functions that I’ve been avoiding thus far.

After euler, then on to TTT.  Although, if it’s before lunchtime, it might be a good time to read one of the books I’m reading--I mean either my clojure book or the scary algorithm book not The Ballard of Songbirds & Snakes, if i ever find time to read that one…

And so, this is what I did today.  I ‘finished’ euler 9, finally, but it is a mess, so before I move on to euler 10, i will commit the first part of the morning tomorrow to clean it up!

I actually, then spent a little time on my blog-site and finally figured out how to run on the local server again from my mac--wasn’t that hard, just had to spend a little bit of time figuring that out.

TTT is still getting close…  I got my algorithm for minimax working today--kind of.  It’s just not optimizing the ‘other’ player’s pretend turn and letting me think that I can win in a way that I can’t win if the other play is paying attention, so will fix that tomorrow.  

Other than that though, today, still felt like progress, so I’m still hoping i can get the kinks worked out by the end of the week.
