Well, it’s the last day of the second to last month of this year.  I don’t have a point there; mostly just reflecting.  

I spent the last 4 days in Austin, TX with my whole family visiting my little brother & his wife as they just had their first baby.  It was a very nice time and really nice to see everyone.  I miss them now; so do Rex & Leo.  

Today I went back at this server with the anticipation that I would certainly finish up the files specs and hopefully even the forms or all of it.  But, http had a different plan for me today, which was that nothing worked.  

I thought i was on to it this afternoon as I had the image in a byte array, but nope.  Then something weird happened.  I decided to system-out-print the request message, and found that after every spec request, there was a secondary request requesting a testroot/favicon.ico.  Apparently this is an internet explorers thing that prints the icon in the favorites or something. Turns out I had bookmarked my local host & port, so I un-favorited that, but still got the secondary request every other ask.  It was happening in safari too.  I couldn't figure out what was causing it, and i couldn’t get the image to show in the browser or the jpg test to pass.  Argh!

Rex:  
Today, i made Rex a little pizza and cut it into quarters.  Keith explained to Rex what a quarter was and that he had a whole pizza which was four quarters.  About 3 minutes later, Rex had almost finished his first piece and exclaimed “Daddy!  I ate one quarter of pizza, and now I have three quarters left on my plate.”  Both Keith and I dropped what we were doing and stared at him for a second before cheering and giving him high fives.  We were very impressed with his super developed intellect!

Leo:  
Leo was smart today too!  We have a little tikes basketball hoop.  It was set to to the tallest setting for Rex.  Leo took a basketball up to it, looked up at the net and dropped the ball under it.  He did this over and over.  Then I lowered the hoop to a level more suited for him.  He picked up the ball, and again dropped it under the net…. Rex showed him what to do properly.  Then Leo picked up a ball, and put it over and into the hoop!  Little geniuses!!
