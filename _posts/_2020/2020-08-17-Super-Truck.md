Alright, I’m back at it again full time and had a great discussion with my brother about structure and guidance going forward.  

I now have to estimate using story points, how complicated i think a story will be.  A story is a a breakdown portion of a program.  This gives me some real-life practice at estimating both the complexity of a project as well as my efficiency, so that’s cool.

One of my projects, as I guessed it might be, is making the GUI for TTT--good thing I kept working on that…  Additionally, I will be adding some new features to my TTT like difficulty, board size, & players.  

I will also continue working the eulers & learning katas.  I solved the basic math for euler 12 today, but it came as no surprise to me that when it came to calculating the final number for solving the euler problem, the processing just took too long…  So, back at that one tomorrow.  Make it more efficient.

Rex:  
I took Rex swimming yesterday.  The only things he likes to do in the pool are scale the wall back to the step and hold on to me for dear life.  I made him learn to reach for & kick to the wall as I helped it ‘swim’ to it.  He didn’t like this and repeatedly asked me in the cutest voice, “you got me?”  “I got you!”  Took a couple times to build up trust.  

As he scaled the wall, he would call for Super Truck (an amazon prime show he likes).  “Super Truck, where are you?  We need your help!  Come under the water!  We’re stuck in the mud!  Mommy, call Super Truck.”  “um…”  “Mommy, call him!”  Over and over and over…  It was very cute.  

Leo:  
Yesterday morning, Leo scared the heck out of me by climbing on top of Rex’s toddler table.  No foresite into how he might get down once up there or the consequences of falling off.  Yikes kid!  And why did he climb the toddler table?  To eat crayons…  The blue one on the floor wasn’t good enough, he also wanted the brown & yellow ones from on top of the table.
