I thought about 19 years ago today.  I’m not going to mention it here… 

So, let’s see.  I started by fixing some of my tests in ttt to test for the UI output.  Then i practiced my coin changer--followed my brother’s a little closer and made mine a lot better.  I was a little frustrated, because all day yesterday I wanted to use reduce but in a map-like way where it would apply it to the first, and then the first & the second, and then the first, second, and third, and so on.  But i couldn’t get it to do that, so i tried longer-route ways.  I was annoyed and wondered why this wasn’t a standard function.  Then i saw in my brother’s kata: reduction, which was exactly what i was trying to do.  It was a standard function…  I just didn’t know how to find it…  annoying, but i’m learning, and I can’t ask what I don’t know to ask or know how to ask…

Then i worked on my presentation--made a little progress, but i’m really struggling for an example for this one.

Then I worked on ttt.  Still not working, but I’m making slow progress..
