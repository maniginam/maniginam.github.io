Title: Ride til I Can’t No Mo'\

Argh, i was super frustrated at the end of the day today.  It’s a long story, but I’d ordered an edible arrangement for my brother & sister-in-law as they were in the hospital after having their first baby: a super cute little girl who made quite the entrance with a very long labor!  I’ve only had c-sections due to my non-statistical talent of only producing breech babies, so I’ve never had to go through labor—personally, i was actually relieved both times to be ‘excused’ from labor, but each time, i couldn’t help but think about the fact that in a way I potentially had a death-date set for me.  Yes, babies can be born just fine even when in the breech position, but there is much higher risk to delivering breech for both the baby and the momma, so as I approached, especially, my first birth, I couldn’t help but to think about the fact that with the aid of modern medicine & technology I was potentially cheating death.

In any case, I’d order this arrangement and sent it to the address I had thinking that some fresh fruit would help to bring them some good spirit.  It all got messed up.  The girl delivering called me to say she was there, but that the hospital couldn’t find them.  She asked if it was the right hospital since there were a couple in the area.  I told her it was the north center (as that’s what I’d been told).  Little did I know that there was a more north one with the same name.  So EA, transferred my order and took it to the north one.  Then i spent well over an hour getting transferred all over the hospital trying to find this arrangement that was delivered and left there.  

After all said and done, they were not at the north hospital, but at the central one.  I will give kudos to EA though, as the manager was super kind and offered to pick it up and take it to the other hospital on her way home, but by that point they’d been discharged, so she then offered to just remake it tomorrow and take it to their home.  

Anyway, on a plus (or a super intimidating) note, i got my next assignment today.  I knew it would involve sockets and threads, but I was a little taken aback by the intensity of it. I won’t say too much about it as the apprenticeship is supposed to be kept quiet, but i have to say that I’m a little intimidated by it.  

I did a bunch of reading about http today with the allowed resources, and I was happy to say, first of all, “wow!” And then “so that’s how the internet works!!”  OMG!  I had no idea!  Suddenly life and the wizardry that is the internet totally makes sense and has become logical.  That was pretty cool, but while that certainly helped me to understand the task at hand, it didn’t really guide me on how to get started.  

I tried to re-do what I’d done with my mentor a couple weeks ago on sockets, but that too has turned into one of those things that made complete sense while I was sitting next to my mentor writing the code, but now on my own is almost like gibberish (i also just learned that gibberish starts with a “g” and not a “j”—mind blown once again).  Don’t worry, I’m not scared off yet.  I’ll keep at it, and I’ll ride til I can’t no mo’!  

Oh, and also tic tac toe is now 100% complete! [check out the code to Tic Tac Toe.](https://github.com/maniginam/TicTacToe)

Rex:  
Rex is a singer now.  He is singing constantly.  Everything from ‘twinkle twinkle” to abc’s to monkeys on the bed to little rabbit foo foo to patty cake to old town road.  He is just always singing:

Then lately, he’s been asking for a ‘dinotruck’ from the show DinoTrux (super clever and creative show by dreamworks on Netflix about (surprise!) dinosaur trucks.  But seriously, these dinotrux are super creative, and the reptools are, well i want a rep tool!  I’ve been very impressed with this show.

Anyway, he’s been asking for one, so I told him we could write to Santa and ask for one.  He described this in detail.  “We will write to Santa.  And then put it in the mailbox? Then I will get a present, and I will open it, and it will be a Dinotruck, and I will play with it and smash?” “Yes, Rex, that’s right!”

Leo:  
Leo, on top of being a champion walker, now says “ball”, tries to say & sign “light’, and says “hi”, like the actual word, while typically waving and blowing kisses to strangers as we walk by them anywhere we are.  Very cute, but beware, the kisses he blows are just as slobbery as the ones he gives face to face.

I also have to give kudos to Keith, because he’s been working with Leo the past couple weeks on sleeping better—both going to sleep & sleeping through the night since he’s been a 2-3 hour waker for his whole life.  He started sleeping through the night after only like 2-3 nights, and then tonight when I fully put him down for the first time since, I sang him a song, then turned off the light, and he, with only a little protest, laid down from standing and went to sleep.  I was kind of wowed.
