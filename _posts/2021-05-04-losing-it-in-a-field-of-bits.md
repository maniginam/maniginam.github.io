Title:  Losing It in a Field of Bits

I’ve made a lot of mistakes, but wtf is a _bitfield?!  Come on!  So close!

After iteration last week, I knew there was going to be one challenge ahead of me for this week that would be on the higher side of difficult.  That was going to be requesting the rooms from the server from the trello js side.  This was proven right by an unexpected challenge--confirming the login status, which I’d originally set through trello storage.  I learned fist thing Monday morning, however, that when I enable the power up while not logged in, Trello kept that token and believed that i was logged in.  I needed the request here too.

Well, I spent most of yesterday and lots of today on that.  Nothing worked.  The server was definitely giving a response, but trello received no body in the response.

I finally gave in thinking that perhaps it’s not possible.  But at that point, it was midnight (I won’t say what time it is now...), and I still had the bigger hurdle in front of me--i had a way around it though--I was going to use my init log to save all the rooms in local storage and then set them with the member--that should work.  But now there’s this bitfield and nothing loops.

Have i mentioned my disdain for javascript?

It’s becoming more & more real, but that’s not the point here. I think I’ve only mentioned the feeling of discouragement once before throughout all this--frustration yes, many times, but true discouragement; I don’t think I’ve brought that up much.  I’ve tried to stay confident and remind myself that I came into this ‘early’ in the sense that I had less experience than most before me and that I’m on my own in the sense that I don’t have the camaraderie of officemates that I can bug from time to time to get a little bit of help.  I mean, even my final, anyone who I would have asked to review my work was on the panel and thus off-limits, so I had Keith, but he was so busy taking care of the boys that I totally get him not being completely enthusiastic to then read and perform an article/procedure.

The last month has been hard--actually since like mid-December has been hard.  I’ve kept it together through the ups and downs, though there have been much more of the latter.  I think I’m losing it though.  With the final and then Cheddar and then Rex thinking that i work all the time and asking any time I come out of the office “Hey Mommy, you’re not working!  Do you want to play with me in my playroom?”  only to have to respond “Omg, yes, i do, but I can’t right now--I’m actually just here to put pajamas on you and trick you into cooperatively coming to brush your teeth by asking if you can help get Leo’s toothbrush set up so that then you can go to bed.”  And with all that, I think i’m losing it.

Losing sanity, and worse, losing confidence.
