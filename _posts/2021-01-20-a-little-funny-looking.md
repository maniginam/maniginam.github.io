Title: They're a Little Funny Looking
date: 2021-01-20

*Sigh...*

I don't know if that's a sigh of relief or frustration or just utter defeat.  Nonetheless, today was productive, and my
game works!  There's still at least one bug that I know of, which there really shouldn't be--all my tests pass, and
I tested for this bug.  Frustrating.  

But it works.  My X's are a little funny shaped still, but fit in the boxes and even turn green when there's a win or gray
for a cat's game--as do the O's of course--they are funny looking too.  

I also got the README done, as it's been made clear to me that the README is very important.  I recall back to my starting
the clojurekoans, where I'd gotten them all done, and then went back to figure something out.  I remember being astonished
that the README was actually very valuable and contained a lot of relevant information.  I've always ignored README's in the past,
probably because they are commanding me to read them.  Plus, who needs directions for an application?  We're all tech-savy people
who can find our own way right?

Anyway, i must bid you ado, as I need to go get the boys so that I can come back and write up a counter-offer to the buyers
who submitted an offer to us yesterday--very exciting that we got, actually, a very good offer in so little time.  We are very
fortunate for that and super excited!  yay!

ta-ta for now
