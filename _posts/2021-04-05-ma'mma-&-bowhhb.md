Title: Ma’m-ma & Bowhh-b
date: 2021-04-05

I had a great weekend with my parents this past weekend--well, mostly my dad as my mom went on a revolutionary war adventure.  My dad and I, unfortunately, didn’t get to code together all that much since we had the boys all weekend, but we got to spend some good time together and watched a couple (to my pleasant surprise) really good movies.  I’m not typically a fan of old movies, but Gaslight was very good--clever, pretty, & entertaining--and The Sting, was very smart and twisty.  

More good news:  In my final moments of working today, I got the trello stories to populate in our poker rooms!!  This was incredibly exciting even when they posted again in duplicate and then triplicate the next two times I refreshed the room.  They are there!  I pulled data--no, no--I request data from a completely separate server than ours--the one doing the requesting.  I got information back, parsed it, and then had our server add it to the rooms.  

That was very exciting!  My tests, well, “First, make it work!”, right?  By that I mean, I didn’t know exactly what I was doing, so I tested that which I could as soon as I could, but the rest was calculated trial & error trying to get the data with a new library and with specific requests.  So, i need to go back and do some more tests.  I also need to clean up the original javascript popups as I don’t like how they are right now.  Even with all that said, I think I can realistically finish up getting all stories without duplicates along with posting stories to trello certainly by the end of the week if not sooner (like Wednesday).

That being said, I need to think about my last challenge and when to do that.  I’d been thinking of going to AZ, but perhaps that’s not necessary, so I’m thinking late this week or early next week would be a good time to start it.

Rex:  
Rex was so sad this morning when he learned that Gramma & Bobby were leaving and going back to their house.  He was pretty solemn all day--even when i picked him up from school he had less of a pep in his step.  It kind of broke my heart to see him that sad.

Leo:  
Leo can say “Mi-ma/Ma-ma/G-ma” for gramma and “Boww!!/Bahuwwp!/Bowww-b!” for Bobby.  He also started saying “ready, set, go!”, but it’s more like: “Ouh!  Ehh!!  Gooooohhhwwww!”

He also found & loved a hat this weekend:
