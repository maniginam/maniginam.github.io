"Eleventeen" is my favorite of all the numbers.  

Eleventeen begs a question though.  Aside from being one of the memorized words/numbers that my three-and-a-half year old, Rex,
spits out when asked to count to twenty, what does Elventeen look like?  What is its math like?  Is is 111 or is it 21 or is it just
something else?  Despite it being very wrong and its lesser version, 11 coming out of nowhere, Eleventeen makes sense.

Just over a month ago, I wrote my closing statement/entry/blog for my apprenticeship.  Since then a lot has happened--i mean, 
Master Eleventeen is damn-near potty trained at this point.  He also has croop along with his little sidekick--Leo-Meo.  We've
been to Chicago and Mauston and Hayward and back, and then I had surgery that counts somewhere between minor & major, and although
I've had two c-sections, this one seemed more major simply due to the requirement of general anesthesia--a first for me.  

Even though I've been tied down, quite literally, with little boys requiring full time attention, I've actually made decent progress on Epic,
 which comes at a great relief and can mean only one of two possibilities.  One, I've suddenly become an amazing coder or Two, integrating
with Trello was really really hard.  

Nonetheless, since abandoning Trello, I've seemed to have made decent, and actually pretty good, progress week over week, despite not
having my normal schedule or even close to enough time.  So that has felt pretty good.

Why am I writing now?  It's no longer required of me to write daily, and perhaps I won't write daily.  I really liked writing and docuemnting
this time period of my life.  I've overcome a huge challenge, but that doesn't mean there aren't more to come.  Why stop writing now when this
time in my life is probably the most rewarding, frustrating, and important time in my life--and no, while it fits, I'm not actually talking about work.

It's about my two little dudes--that's what it's all about afterall.  My blog was always mine, but now, since it's no longer requried, it's truly mine, and I will
write about whatever I damn-well please.  In all honestly, my topics probably won't sway much from those of my former posts: life!  Life as a 'new-ish' mother; 
life as a working mother of toddlers.  Life as a Hashtag boy-mom (at least for now and for the foreseeable future, but won't that be fun to write about when the occasion arises?!).
Eleventeen steps to a happy life.

I can't not state the irony, that it was 11 months ago to the day that I wrote my first post called the same as this one: "Eleventeen".
