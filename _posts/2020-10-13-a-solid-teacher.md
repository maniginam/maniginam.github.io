title: He’s a Solid Teacher

I’m sorry; I have to admit I missed blogging yesterday…

Alright, now that I’ve told on myself, let’s move forward.  Yesterday, I had the privilege of working with my dad, who just so happens to be a ‘solid’ teacher, on my game-of-life kata.  He showed me a better way to go about it which I merged with my way of doing it, and it ended up being more efficient and allowed for an infinite world.  I’ve practiced it a couple times since to completion, and I think i should be ready to get it sync’d up with a GUI later this week and finally, record the whole thing, or perhaps the other way around--record then make GUI to ensure i complete my iteration this week.

Additionally today, my dad and I spent several hours reviewing the package/component principles and then reviewing databases and schemas for using them.  We went over relational databases, which are perhaps being phased out, and also event sourcing and why this is a better method for managing databases as well as the risks of updating databases and of using textually based databases.  

This discussion came about when i told him that I’d done my MySQL assignment pretty much completely wrong, and unknowingly cheated by using h2, which is an easier database based on MySQL.  So we discussed this and came up with a schema for ttt.  I also got some more homework to do to further enrich my knowledge of managing databases, which is to review Conn’s Normal Form.

I ended up getting MySQL to work in the terminal today and created a table and even filled it.  Tomorrow, i should be be able to get ttt to save to it without too many hiccups.  It’s an annoying language to write in with the caps and strings and language, but ultimately, it’d kind of fun directly playing in a database that isn’t excel.

Rex:  
So Rex got to go on two plane rides yesterday.  He did great, and after the first one, he was asking to go again. Fortunately, we had to take another to get back home after dropping my mom off in Slidell.  In the airport, i got Rex some Cheetos as a quick snack, and made the mistake of allowing him to hold the bag.  When it was time to go, he threw a fit at me taking away the Cheeto bag for the reason that i did not want him to paint the plane orange, and was from then on in a horrible mood.  At one point after getting him fully buckled in his seat, he was still screaming and wiped his hand across his nose.  I immediately saw he’d removed a giant, sticky, gross, booger that was on the back of his hand.  He was about to wipe it on the plane, but i had a napkin ready to go and wiped it.  This was not the right move for changing Rex’s mood as he became enraged that i took his booger.  That was his booger and he wanted it back:  “That’s my booger!  I need my booger!  Give me my booger!  You can’t have my booger!!!!!”  To calm him, I had to (shhh… *pretend*) to put it back into his nose.  This pleased him, and he finally calmed down once he had his booger back.

Leo:  
Leo has been chatting up a storm lately.  “Uh”. “Tuh tuh tuh”.  He’s also become quite a clingy little monkey, which amused my mom when he hung on to her with both his arms and legs any time she went to put him down.  This kid is also walking up a storm and believes he’s now a pro-stander. He’s not…
