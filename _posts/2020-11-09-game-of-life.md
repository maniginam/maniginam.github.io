Let’s see.  Today, i started by finishing the video for my [Game-of-Life Kata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwk9mmQtYOc). I think it looks pretty good, but let’s see what y’all have to say about [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwk9mmQtYOc).  Feel free to comment & like.

After this, i thought i had all the time in the world to finish all the TODO’s in TTT.  Ha!  While i did have all that time, everytime I went to fix something, something else broke--sometimes my tests and sometimes the production code.  Fragile & rigid for sure!

Nonetheless, I think it is getting better.  I’m certainly eager for my next assignment, so I’m working hard to get this done efficiently.

You’d think I’d have a bunch to talk about seeing as I was out of town for so long recently, but I’m kind of at a loss for what else to say…  Until next time I guess.

Rex:  
Rex has started transitioning from saying “Meo” to “Leo”.  This makes me sad.  He also says “Look up below” correctly now.  This makes me sad also.  His grammar and vocabulary continue to amaze me, as do his negotiating skills.  At bedtime, he’ll ask to watch 1 more show, and then quickly correct it to “no I want to watch 2 shows!”  Or when he wants us to play with him: “Mommy, can you come play with me for ten minutes?”  How can you say no to that?  Sometimes though, he’ll accidentally say “in ten minutes”.  I say yes to this also.  

Leo:  
I think i’ve mentioned that Leo is a walking champ now.  He tries to walk most of the time instead of crawling, and he get so proud when he’s doing it.  He’ll often grunt at me to look at him when he’s made several steps--and it’s a different grunt than when I try to eat food or drink water in front of him without sharing!  This kid is an endless pit when it comes to food.
