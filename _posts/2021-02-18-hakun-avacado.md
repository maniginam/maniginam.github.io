Title: Hakun-Avacado

Yikes, the “can you believe it’s already mm/did” are already wanting to come out of me this year.  Those are inevitable, and i will refrain for now.  

Today was a new experience.  I worked on my task in poker.  Navigating the deep ocean of someone else’s code is...well, it’s a journey.  And the code I’m navigating is probably some of the highest standard of code out there—meaning that it’s well mapped and the stars are brightly shining.  I can only imagine navigating the treacherous waters of bad code and thus without a map on a stormy night with giant waves trying to knock me over the entire expedition. 

Still, navigating someone else’s code takes a lot of analysis and, well, navigating and re-orienting.  You have to follow the flow, but the flow is abstract, and in this case, a lot more advanced than anything I’ve ever written.  It’s kind of like a choose-your-path book.  In fact it’s probably exactly like that, except there are clues telling you which direction to go, but you still have to turn the page to get there.

I got some authorizations done, but they are currently all done in cljs, and so I need to figure out how to move those authorizations to clj for a higher level of security.  This of course needed to be done with our circular dependencies, and I’m nervous to add unnecessarily to someone else’s code.  I’ve already changed a few functions that took specifics out of a map, to just feed it the entire map so that the function at hand can just use what it needs, but even this is nerving.  

After i got it poorly authorizing users, i went on to query the database and pull out the count of users.  That’s where I ended as I had to get the boys.  

It’s amazing how much time you can spend on just a few lines of code and trying to fit them into the right place—without breaking the rest of it.  I guess it’s like having a few puzzle pieces, but they’re made of glass, and you’re trying to fit them in together without really know exactly where they should go without studying it more, but you have an idea even if they don’t perfectly fit, so you try to wiggle them in and maybe even apply some force, just hoping that they will slide in and also that you don’t break the whole puzzle, which would of course, warrant the whole puzzle useless.  There you got it!  So, now that it kind of fits together, go ahead and refactor that sentence without breaking its purpose.  

It’s all good & fun, but certainly new waters to navigate.  I will also add that these waters I’m navigating now, while they might be of the highest standard, are at a level much more advanced than my own, and thus have added challenges of not only understanding but also trying to create dialect with the same level of vocabulary & grammar.

Rex:  
This evening I was doing sing-a-longs with Rex to Disney movies—both young & old.  I played the live Hakuna Matata video for him, and he was obsessed with the eating bugs scene.  He wanted to watch it over & over. 

Mid-way through the second play, Tails came over and started whimpering (she does this a lot recently, but i’m not sure why).  I said to her, “What Tails?  You want to be a lion?  You do saunter like a lion, but you always walk into walls and fall off of stairs ‘cause you don’t watch where you are walking.”  Rex adds on to my comments to tell to her “Silly Tails!  You’re not a lion.  You’re just a dog.”   

After live-action finished the second time, he still wanted to watch it again, so I played the cartoon version from him.  He enjoyed this almost as much, except this time he’d started to learn the song and recognize the words.  Again about mid-way through, he comments, “That’s not Hakun-Avacado!  That’s silly!”

Leo:  
Leo’s favorite words these days are 1. ball and 2. mom.  

He will say either one repeatedly.  He also gets really excited when you understand him, and still cheers for himself when he accomplishes something (don’t we all?).  

For instance, if he gets the cup in the cupholder, that’s super applause worthy.  Getting an arm through a sleeve?  Now that’s a standing ovation!  Buckling his car seat (don’t grimace over the fact that it’s probably sideways and not exactly buckled), that’s worth a sky-banner.  Getting Mommy’s shoe on his foot, well no, that’s just immensely frustrating, because they fall off on the first step, so he screams his second favorite word to beckon me to help.  But stacking 3 medium size boxes (think 12-pack bottle/can boxes) on top each other to make a tower—Nobel peace prize level applause for sure!
