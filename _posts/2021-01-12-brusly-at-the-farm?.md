Title: Brusly at the Farm?
date: 2021-01-12

Well that's annoying.  I just refactored all of my httpServer so that
the responders don't each create individual builders, and instead so that the 
connection creates and uses the builder.  Additionally, the connection should be adding
  the serverName.  This makes sense.  Everything passed, but herein lies the problem.

I went back to my webttt, and argh, I can't ".put" into an APersistentMap, so
now I need to figure out how to get java to add to a clojure map.  I feel liek it was doing it just fine
before, but it doesn't like this instance of it...

Perhaps if i sleep on it, i will figure it out.  For now i need to finish up to get
the boys, then feed them, then do some more packing.  

I'll get there...

Rex:
So a few days after Brusly died, Rex woke up in the morning and asked
where she was.  I told him that she was gone, perhaps I said sleeping forever.
He replied, "No, she's not.  She's running very fast at the farm."
Never once did Keith or I ever mention a farm to him...  That is not how we
wanted to handle this, so this was weird.  Then today, while he was eating breakfast,
he told me "Mommy, Brusly is flying!"  I am not religious nor do I beleive in heaven, but
this too was an appropriate, and some would believe accurate, statement that again,
neither Keith nor I ever mentioned to him.  I suppose someone else could have or freakin' cocomelon!
Regardless, I'm glad he's having happy thoughts about her.  

Leo:
The other day, i was having a cup of hot tea.  Leo walked up to it to see it.
He looked at me and said a very breathy "Hathhhhh" and then proceeded
to "ffffffff" over it, which is how he blows to cool something that is hot.
I know this is deliberate, not only because the action was deliberate,
but also because, he's done this to his own food, afterwhich, he proceeded
to lightly touch it to check it before grabbing it and eating it.
