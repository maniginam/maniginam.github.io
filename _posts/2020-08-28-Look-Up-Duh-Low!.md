While Marco was a dud on Mon & Tues, Laura tore through Lake Charles, LA.  She tore the roof off of one of their casinos!  Lake Charles is about 2 hours from where I live.  I used to have to go there for work pretty frequently as we had a sister plant out there.  I’m actually a pretty big fan of Lake Charles.  There seems to be a decent amount of stuff to do there, and there are some pretty decent restaurants.  

Here in Baton Rouge, Laura was pretty uneventful.  It was a little weird having her come pass through in the middle of the night.  While I was sleeping, it all of a sudden got very windy outside.  I woke up from the windows shaking and the wind both howling and whistling simultaneously.  When I looked out the window, I got a glimpse of the terror that a hurricane can bring--what they probably experienced in Lake Charles.  Isaac, back in 2012, hadn’t given me that feeling.  Laura was a little chilling.  

By morning, she was gone.  It was still raining and there was still some wind, but not anything like during the previous night.  By afternoon it was sunny, and I took the boys in the rain-cooled (almost cold) pool.

On to coding.  I spent much of the day researching and trying to understand The Open Closed Principle.  I think I understand the overall concept of the principle, but I’m still not sure how to apply it--especially in clojure.  I actually talked to my little brother about this the other day, and he helped me to get a better understanding of it also.  

I was wanting to put it into action within TTT to use that as an example for my presentation, but i failed horribly for the remainder of the day at that.  So all in all, thanks to the hurricanes, i did not accomplish much of what was required this week…  Except i did just get one of the printables out of the tests finally.  That’s actually where I started with the OCP today.  I wanted to separate it all out to follow the principles instead of making work arounds.  In the end, i made the work arounds, but, hey, they work!  Just a couple more to pull out...

Rex:  
Look up duh-low!!!!  He says as a truck launches off a ramp, which is the bed of a dump truck, and flies through the air over on lookers “duh-low” (below).

Leo:  
Whenever the door to outside opens, Leo stops whatever he is doing and makes a run for it.  Hence the hurricane showers yesterday...  
I should also mention that he's been biting a lot lately!  The other day, he bit poor Rex on the nose and wouldn't let go...
