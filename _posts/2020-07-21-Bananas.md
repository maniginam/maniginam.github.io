Progress--finally!  Today, i worked on my algorithm and looked into minimax.  I’m working on getting a grasp of how minimax works without having someone give me the answer.  I think I get it.  

In anycase, i’ve made yet another step forward in TTT!  Feels good.  I also made a little progress on euler-9, but had to run out before I could finish it.  Need to figure out how to remove a layer of vectors…

At the advice of my dad, I also recently bought the book “The Art Of Computer Programming” by Donald Knuth.  I’ve ‘started’ reading it, meaning that I’ve read the preface and the procedure for how to read it and even started chapter one.  The book itself is kind of a monster with a lot of math (it’s a good thing I like math, but it will test how much math I remember), but I’m intrigued and trying to go at it with ease so as to not overwhelm myself.  I think it will be a good experience to read, but i definitely need to read it one page at a time and not get ahead of myself.

Tomorrow, i get to sit in another one of my dad’s clean code virtual classes.  Those are fun for me!  It’s fun to watch my sister welcome & introduce the students, and it’s fun to watch my dad teach a group of students.  It’s also been interesting for me to hear their questions.  It’s a very cool opportunity for me to have, and I’m enjoying it.

Rex:  
Over the early Covid days while I was up north staying with my sister, my nieces and I made a race track out of beans & spaghetti for Rex.  He still has this racetrack and plays with it almost daily.  It’s very cute.  Last night he was playing with it, and against my inner-judgement of encouraging imaginative playtime and discouraging screen-time, we decided to teach him how to play MarioKart.  He kind of got it, and he definitely had fun trying to play.  

I found it funny how in the middle of a race, he suddenly got an urgent craving for a banana--maybe from the bananas trailing his kart--and insisted I stop mid race to fetch one for him.

Leo:  
Have you ever had someone stand in front of you and just yell at you over & over & over while you are clearly busy trying to put shoes on the other child in the room?  This is Leo.  If I’m not holding him or touching him, he will stand (supported by the couch) and just yell at me until I look at him, at which point, he gives me a huge smile and reaches for me to pick him up.  The yelling is real and constant.
