oh... time management is a pain!  I'm so bad at it.

That being said, I completed euler 5 today and started & completed euler 6--it was
kind of an easier one, so i just did it.  Still, it was very exciting to have completed
two eulers in one day!

I also got my 'X' to float in tic tac toe.  By float, i mean that at the on set of the Start event, 
and 'X' follows the mouse while it is 'YOUR_TURN'.  That was very exciting.  Now I'm trying to change the object
to set it in place once the box is clicked.  This is tough & i think i think i may have too many objects
and sub-objects, so i'm getting a little wrapped up in where the hell I am in the depth of the objects...
I'll get there...

Rex:  
Today, Rex hunted for coins in the school parking lot and found a whole dollar in quarters--I didn't even
put them down for him.  These were legit found quarters.

Then i showed him a tree star.  He got excited, picked it up, and started to sing
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star".  It was so cute.  I even tried to embed a video of it below, but I don't think
it's working, so I'll come back to it.
