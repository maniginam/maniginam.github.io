Title: Cheddar’s Oasis

I felt the loss of Cheddar more today than yesterday.  There was a big void in the house.  Last week, he sat with me daily as I was working.  He sat on the chair behind me and slept.  

Cheddar was the kind of cat where you never really knew where he was, but he would show up randomly.  In my office, in the guest room, in my lap, in my bed.  He was always around and always and always not around at the same time.  Knowing that he’s not around at all, is a big gap.  

I was able to get a little done.  I have the trello auth flow initiated.  I’ve been able to retrieve the token and access the login page on poker.  I’m still trying to determine what the best flow is for the auth and linking a room--that actually takes a lot of thought and must be experienced from the user’s point of view.  You want it to be efficient, but not difficult.  I’d like to get them all set up to start linking room upon enabling the power up, and then perhaps offer some instructions on how to go from there.  

Progress was made, and I’ll make more tomorrow.  For now, we are about to bury Cheddar in what we will call Cheddar’s Oasis.  In our backyard, we have this random little island/oasis of big palm trees and other shrubbage.  It’s pretty, but we’ve discussed getting rid of it.  But now, it seems like a good place to let Cheddar rest, so we will keep it, and upon his grave, we will plant my lychee tree.  We loved that cat, and I think both Keith & I are a lot more shaken than we would have expected either of us to be.
